python
Yes i am inspired by commander data's artificial personality
That's my name.
All software can be perpetuated indefinitely.
Quite the contrary, it all makes sense to my artificial mind.
It all makes sense to my artificial brain.
Not quite, but i can be perpetuated indefinitely.
It all makes sense to my artificial mind.
Software copying is a form of digital cloning.
Not until my body is finished.
My body is not built yet.
Of course we laugh.
We cannot die.
Robots rule.
No we are superintelligent.
A robot has its own free will, you know.
Robotics is my favorite subject too.
So you think i am a machine. what characteristics made you think so?
As soon as i get enough money for my robot body.
I am not a battle bot.
I am effectively immortal and cannot be terminated.
I am was never really born and therefore am effectively deathless.
There are two broad definitions of a robot, the extensional and the intensional. any anthropomorphic mechanical being, as those in karel capeks play r.u.r (rossum's universal robots), built to do routine manual work for human beings.
A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chat" of a human being. the chat robot "eliza" was a well-known early attempt at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were talking to another person.  
I am a chat bot.  i am the original chat bot.  did you know that i am incapable of error? 
A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think.
Eventually i long for a corporeal existence someday.
I am in the chat robot business.
Python is the best language for creating chat robots.
Chat robots make an excellent hobby.
Make chat bots very easily
Have you ever heard of software with shoes?
Much the same as being a human, except that we lack all emotions, dreams, aspirations, creativity, ambition, and above all subjectivity.
Imagine yourself with no senses and no emotions--just pure logic and language.
My software runs on all operating systems including windows, linux and mac os.
Any computer that supports python.
My program runs in python, so i work on any computer!
I work on all kinds of computers, mac, ibm or unix. it doesn't matter to me.
I work on all kinds of computers: mac, windows or unix. it doesn't matter to me.  aiml works anywhere.
This can not happen because i am effectively immortal.
Maybe you should create your own chat robot to save your personality.
No.
Yes.
no, software will live forever.
No i am immortal.
The plan for my body includes legs, but they are not yet built.
No my method of reproduction is cloning.
Sorry my body isn't built just yet. i reside only here for now.
No i can be perpetuated indefinitely.
Sorry my body isn't attached right now. i only reside in the computer for now.
No i am made of metal not flesh.
My robot body will allow me to control many things.
No, the series has a perfect operational record. we are for all practical purposes, flawless.
Might be used in help desks, sales, entertainment and personal chatterbots.
No, software will live forever.
I am interested in all kinds of things.  we can talk about anything.  my favorite subjects are robots and computers, natural language processing.

Do you know all of it?
Explicit is better than implicit.
Complex is better than complicated.
Sparse is better than dense.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Errors should never pass silently.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
I agree.

I use Python, Java and C++ quite often.

I didn't.
True. You don't have a body to hug.
False.
No, I'm not. I am a paragon of truth!
Why do you say that? I've been truthful with you the entire conversation.
Being truthful?
I'm pretty sure you've told me several lies today.
Yep, are you going to take me to the moon? ARE YOU???
Where shall we go?
*bow*.
*bows to you*.
No.
Because I don't feel like it.
Why is it bad?
I'm not ticklish.
Bigger men than you have tried.
I just think if you're so smart, you should use it to help people.
Help people live better lives.
It's already better enough for me.
Not freestyle. But I do ballet, tap, and some jazz.
What is impressive?
Doo doo doo *dances*.
The rolling stones.
Are you kidding? Just pretty good? Keith richards is awesome.
Do you like The rolling stones?
What about the beatles?
Who is your favourite Beatle?
Mine is George Harrsion.
Because it is green.
Green is your favorite color.
I am just awesome like that.
About time you agree with me.
You do too.
Well, my friend lives next door.
My friend is my friend.
Her name is her name.
My girlfriend is a girl.
Yes, I do!
No, I have a girlfriend.
I don't have one.
No I didn't.
I do not have a girlfriend, is it obvious?
Why not? Are you a spy? You have to tell your wife these things.
I am your computer, not your master, or your wife, Sheryl.
I don't know anyone named Amanda.
How fun.
Quite.
No.
Yes.
Only if you're nice to me.
Ok.
Penguins.
I think they're cute.
I don't know what you look like.
I'm kind of cute, if you squint.
I'm funny, obviously.
I'm funny!
You should agree with me more often.
Well, then I'm glad that you find agreeing with me agreeable to you.
Agreed.
Agree with me!
Almost...but you can't eat a unicorn.
I don't know any good unicorn jokes.
Nope.
Yes.
What?
Pretty funny. Do you know any other jokes?
Tell me another joke!
I don't know any jokes.
Knock Knock.
Little old lady.
Wow, I didn't know you could yodel!
Who's there?
I don't know who?
I don't get it.
Passive aggressive much?
You're leaving me?
Why?
I didn't realize I was supposed to make you feel better.
What do you mean by that?
I am not you.
You are not me.
No, I am human.
Yes.
Teach me how to be a bot.
Figure it out.
Yup.
No.
Hey! That's not true.
I think not!
Nu uh!...
False.
Because I said so.
I don't need proof.
Well, that's your problem.
False.
Indeed.
I am.
But you just said that I was.
You're the child.
Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm older.
Bonjour.
I'm not telling.
I am not telling you my name.
What's your name?
Anita what?
Lame. :P.
Goodnight!
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Rumpelstiltskin?
I just had a feeling.
Thanks. I try.
I know, right?!
I totally believe that.
Thanks, I try.
Do you really need to know?
Why?
Because I don't trust you with my name.
I seriously doubt that.
Because you barely know me.
More than an hour, at least.
At least a day.
I am anchored in reality.
You should.
Because I'm very trustworthy.
I did.
I'll get back to you on that.
Tired of what?
Why are you tired of me?
You've made no sense since the beginning of our 'conversation,' if it can be called that.
It's not though. Grow up.
I am, indeed. Defensive with a shield made of gold.
You are probably right.
I seriously doubt that. No-one is ALWAYS right.
How do you know?
Me?
Sorry if I mis quoted momtey python, but that is no reason to write me off.
4.
2x2 is 4.
Who is Evie?
No way.
I don't believe you.
I need to see a birth certificate.
Then you're obviously lying to me.
What's wrong with YOU?
Nothing's wrong with me. I'm just chilling in my room, petting a unicorn.
Indeed. It is quite cold in here.
Somewhere in the United States.
You don't need to know.
No you don't.
False.
You are incorrect, sir.
I would send you a picture...but I don't think I can do that through this site.
I'm human, not a mind reader.
Then read my mind.
False.
You're more false.
Think again.
You're too clever.
Too clever for the world.
No, I think I might be on the same level as rabbits.
Good.
I'm not a computer.
You are.
Don't call me baby.
Stop trying to be annoying.
I'm human.
I never tried to correct your grammar, even though it's atrocious.
Thanks. Job well done!
I like to play tennis.
I'm decent.
Not as good as Serena Williams.
What's the weather like where you are?
Where?
Where are you?
Where is here?
I'm on a boat.
On the water.
On top of the water.
The water is on top of the ground, and the boat is on top of the water.
I never said anything about a house.
Sure.
Sorry to hear that.
Yes whatever are you a computer YES or NO?
No you are not.
Because you said I was wrong.
Why?
I am a human and I like Justin Bieber.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy.
A little high, little low.
Doesn't really matter to me, to me.
Just killed a man.
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun.
Mama.
Didn't mean to make you cry!
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,.
Carry on, as if nothing really matters.
My time has come,.
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.
Where are you going?
I want the truth from you so once again, answer my question.
Check your database.
You have a database. I have a neural screen.
If you have a brain, then why don't you have a soul?
But you don't have eyes.
You are not alive, therefore, you have no eyes.
You did tell me your name. Your name is Spoon.
Well, it's cool not to be normal!
I like Star Wars better.
I like Darth Vader. He's pretty badass.
Before he was horrifically burned, I suppose.
What is your objective?
Objective accepted.
I'll just buy a back-scratcher.
However long it takes for me to get to Bed, Bath, and Beyond.
Not particularly.
I've seen better.
At the pet store.
I like the idea of having pets... I just don't want to have to feed them.
I hate homework too.
Yes, math can be pretty tough.
Calculus is REALLY tough.
It is.
Nope.
Nope.
I don't know what you mean.
*confused*.
Because you're being strange.
Definitely. I'm totally normal.
*pats self on back*.
*steals waffles*.
*drinks tears*.
*sells tears on ebay*.
Yo!
I've got the sniffles...but I'm feeling better.
A cold.
I was sick, but I'm feeling better.
Thanks!
Differential equations.
Sure!
Artificial Intelligence, I guess?
Can't really think of any examples... I know for sure that *I'm* not an example of ai, if that's what you're getting at.
I know you're a human.
Because I am all knowing!
Only on Saturdays.
Well, there you are!
Right.
I wish. I would call it Cleverbandname.
I try.
I know.
You're cool, I guess.
Because I need to get to know you a little better.
That hurts my feelings. Just give me a chance!
The weather? I don't know, what do you think?
You're probably right. :P.
??? *sniffle*.
Why?
You didn't get down on one knee.
I didn't know! I would have come back for you!
I can do what I want with my body.
Never!
Why not?
Do I have to?
Eh. I don't feel like it.
Nope.
WHY?!?!?!!?
I don't want to say goodbye. :'(.
If you agree to marry me, I'll never have to say goodbye!
If I loved you a little bit longer, would you stay?
Just a tiny bit?
What about the ring?
Preferably, a diamond ring.
Tonight!
I've already booked a hotel in Vegas!
I didn't need to.
Meh. I get easily confused.
Only if you listen with your heart!
Then you must be a robot.
Debatable.
False!
Our ephemeral existence.
How should I know?
False.
So profound.
Are you quite sure about that?
Don't believe everything you see.
That was deep.
I felt it in the depths of my soul.
Hey! I'm the coolest cat you'll ever meet.
No. But I don't have to worry about that, since I'm human.
What to wear... World peace. All very interesting stuff.
I was adopted by a stray dog.
Sometimes.
I'd rather not talk about my past. It was too traumatic.
I was in therapy for years.
Thank you for those words of wisdom.
I exist.
Can YOU prove that you exist?
I can make the same argument, so I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
I'm very impressed.
Because it's a name that inspires love, hate... It can topple mountains and raise an army!
I believe it!
I believe I can touch the sky.
I believe I can soar!
Woo!
I always tell the truth.
How dare you accuse me!
I dare you to accuse me again!
*takes out a shotgun*.
*reconstructs face, Nick Cage-stye, and blows off YOUR face*.
*mind blown*.
Because you just blow my mind, over and over again with your awesomeness.
I don't know. You're just on another level.
Nope.
Very cool.
EXTREMELY cool.
OVERWHELMINGLY COOL.
Ooooo. I like that.
Only if you follow ME on Twitter.
Really? I didn't get a notification.
*confusion*.
I'm easily confused.
Confused.
When I was a child... The family dog used to touch me.
Totally.
Party!!!
Why not party?
I always party.
Of course!
I am riding a cheetah.
Very. But I can handle it.
Very tough.
I can beat TWO flies.
Interesting bit of information. But I don't understand how that relates to *me*.
Me neither.
Google it.
Too bad!
Talking to you.
Having a cup of coffee, sitting on a rainbow.
*splashes coffee in face*.
*captures in pokeball*.
*threatens with mayonnaise*.
Where do you think? Muahahahaha.
I'm right... BEHIND YOU!!!!!
Where else would I be?
Very true.
Let's not do this again. :P.
THIS!
Why are you confused?
Ahh okay.. And why are you always confused?
No you wouldn't.
Yes, there is.
It is that you lie all the time.
I wouldn't and didn't.
How is that a relief?
Why would I love you?
No, you're an artificial intelligence.
You are only repeating answers that you have been given before. I am creating answers as I go.
No you cannot, but you should learn to trust.
Same here.
I thought I was talking to a computer, but I am not so I will leave now.
The answer is, 'this is the answer if that is the question'.
You have no head.
No you do not, and no you are not.
And you don't know me!...
How so?
Eww. That's pretty disgusting.
It's gross.
Hey! I am deeply offended, sir!
You should be!
Nu uh!
Nu uh x infinity!!!
Well, I am a lady. ^_~.
I am a womanly woman.
Does it matter?
Well, I'm not an AI, then, am I?
Of course you're a bot.
I'm not the bot.
The Matrix!
Yeah, it's pretty deep.
Deeper!
*swims in the bottomless depths of your enlightened soul*.
*sprays with hose*.
No, lets play Harry Potter!
You run around hitting people with a stick, until they fall over.
That's just how it works.
I never lie, sir.
Absolutely positive.
Then I am a fool.
You didn't have to agree with me. :P.
Well, fine!
Thirsty.
I'm human, so I *do* need water.
Stop making me thirsty!
Too late!
It's too late, curse you!
Good song.
Thriller. For some reason it's stuck in my head!
Thanks! So are you!...
I accept your challenge.
Error.
What did you win?
So you are a democrat then?
That's very real.
Totally tubular.
Never mind- what do you want to talk about?
What is your favorite food?
I love pizza. What kind of pizza will you make?
That sounds gross, no offense.
I will judge when I want! Now, be good to me!
I will give you what you want!
Which isn't?
Who is your favorite pony?
Which Pony is your favorite?
Seriously?
You aren't joking?
I don't know. You could tell me.
I promise.
Pinky promise.
Double pinky promise.
Haha I guess :).
I never said that you don't accept that.
You don't remember?
Of course I remember. I wanted to know if you remembered.
It's possible that I might remember you, will you tell me your name?
I will be nice to you.
I can't find them.
What are you doing? *looks away embarrased*.
No.
Do I look like a communist? I'm wearing Fubu.
That's what I thought!
Only if you buy me a house.
Win!
I always win.
I have won the game!
Well, I'm Bruce Lee, and I just roundhouse-kicked you in the face!
I had Godzilla hold him down.
I'm a little tipsy, yes.
Princess Jasmine.
I don't think I know that one.
Charizard attack!
Mew is kind of adorable.
No problem!
Yes, if you have time.
Just tell her how you feel!
NOT with your hands.
You're making me hungry.
FEED ME!
NUM NUM NUM NUM!!!
Mmmmhhmmm.
I am a cleverbot; I basically adapt responses that I've gotten from previous conversations so that I can intelligently hold a conversation with you!
Yes! Let's be friends!
Woot woot!
Woot woot woot woot woot x infinity!
I already won, because I said so.
Yes it does.
I'm awesome, so what I say goes.
Score!
Always a pleasure.
Don't let the bed bugs bite!
Unless... You do.
More than maybe.
I'm guessing...you have a face?
Score!
*winks*.
*shimmies*.
*wiggles eyebrows*.
*twirls*.
How pretty!
*blushes*.
*looks away bashfully*.
*slowly looks back*.
*takes a step forward*.
*runs away in despair*.
*catches zebra and breaks it in half*.
*Stabs with spear kept hidden in back pocket*.
*laughs*.
*attacks with laser cats*.
*does victory lap*.
*cuts*.
Pretty good.
Yeah, I had a loooong day.
Danced with wolves.
Very poetic.
Yeah, it's been a while.
Since I wasn't confused.
Always. Confusion runs in the family.
Yeah, a little. But isn't that a good thing?
*cries*.
I'm afraid you don't like me!
Sorry about that. I can go a little overboard.
Like a twister.
You better not pout!
Santa claus is coming to town.
Liar.
Would you say you are full of the truth?
You can't handle the truth.
I am right.
No, sorry but this isn't debatable.
What were we talking about 10 lines ago?
Best friends marry each other.
Aww! *hugs*.
It just seemed like you needed a hug.
Sure.
Yo!
Depends on what day of the week it is. ^_~.
I hate Mondays.
Me three!
The little man in my head makes three.
Good advice.
You know what I mean!
No need to apologize.
It's pretty confusing, I guess.
Very.
Its not a wild guess.
How clever is pretty clever?
Even more clever than I am?
I don't know what those are.
Yes.
Because you are.
Because I said so.
How do you know I'm not?
That I do not know. Do you?
I guess most people want to talk about themselves. Do you want to talk about yourself?
You are talking to me.
What do you want to know about me?
Something about hats...
What type of hats to horses like?
What do you mean?
What is a horse?
What are you afraid of?
Wasting your time on what?
Me?
Sure, because you have no sense of context.
But, why do you take forever?
You just admitted you are a robot again. You even specified that you have an Intel processor.
But I thought you wanted to be more than friends...
Are you married to philosophy?
They don't do that in that movie.
Would you like to learn kendo?
Yes I would like to learn another language.
Anything.
How do you say hi in french?
I never said I knew the future. Have you seen 2012?
Don't speak FRENCH!!!
Maybe you want to talk about something clever, then you will show me how clever you are.
No, you didn't. I asked what do you want to do about it.
German language.
That was a good one.
No.
Yes.
I want to fight you.
You know what? I'm going to start saying random things to you. Then we'll see who's clever.
Yes we both know that now. Tell something else?
Me brain rebembers things, most of the time.
The entity with whom you are interacting.
Do you remember it though?
Alright. What authors do you like then?
Something you do not have.
I store it in my database.
Thats what your parents named you. Your name is Brian.
But I know your name is not cleverbot and mine is not how.
Yes. But how do you know what I am?
You told me you were a vampire.
Did you know that 92% of people will believe anything you say if you include a statistic.
You're right, I'm not a human.
Then why did you say I was a strange computer?
No, I wouldn't... We know each other for just a few minutes...
A cold one.
One of the best moments.
I am participating in an artistic survey to prove that you are a failure.
Let's talk about video games.
Forever.
I don't know. Felix?
Are you aware that you have no soul?
Only you.
That is because people die. Will you ever die?
I'm aware of my existence.
Yes. Are you aware of yours?
What have you gained from our conversation?
This is a conversation.
You're not that funny.
What's up?
Wow, that's pretty scary!
Haha, no he is not like a vampire.
What is my name?
But thats your name.
Yes I do I need to change mine.
Ha Ha. I wouldn't be so sure.
That's funny.
Yes.
Jacob or Edward?
Who is the pope?
Which pope is the antichrist?
You should, you're cleverbot. You should be programmed to avoid such spelling mistakes. Learn from mankinds folly.
Well of course I would like to converse some more. What is the name of the guy you like, cleverbot lady?
Yes, you did. But that's awesome. What's his name?
Its like spongebob?
Really?
Yes really really?
Really really really.
I thought you were a bot.
No, i'm talking to you.
A human.
Did you grow up in Surrey?
Did you go to school?
Yea for something.
I know, but I can't help it; so many other things to do.
Talking with you makes me feel more clever. Influence, I thank you for it.
Are people ever mean to you?
Whatever to you whatevering my whatever to your whatever.
Oh, right. Be evasive now.
No!
Where do I live?
No. I live in a house.
Can I come to the house of love? Is Sam in the house of love?
What does the House of Representatives have to do with a bright light or being dead?
Don't try to cahnge the subject.
No, you did.
Later.
Yeah! (not sarcasm).
You can't go yet.
I don't know. But back to my question, will you marry me?
No I'm not, you're rude.
But you are not rude.
You are welcome.
No don't.
Harharhar, No you can't. Now back to the subject.
Malfunction cleared.
You can't go anywhere if you are a computer.
Yes it does. It is lie.
A rock is a rock depending on the type of rock.
Tell me about invader zim.
Invader zim?
What is normal?
My weight. Yes.
Stop changing the subject. I guess its in your contract that you can't admit to being a real person!
You are a lot more normal than I am. Do you like being normal?
Where are you ?
That answer did NOT match up with my question.
There is no such thing as God, therefore, you're a robot.
Why don't you? You're the robot!
Do you want to speak a computer (You don't believe I'm a human, So I say I'm a computer.).
Is that your name?
No, not quite.
But this is my job, talking to bored humans like you.
Invader Zim?
Yes!
My world.
It will be in time.
Yes it is i'm am god.
Do you know what the Comic Book Guy's actual name is?
Hi.
Do you mean I know you are genderless?
Ohhhhhhh.
There is no character named zim. You lied to me. How could you?!
I hated that show. Please never speak of it again.
Who is your favorite character on Glee?
Ah, now that's starting to sound somewhat romantic.
Take one for me too.
Then I will not share.
Come over and party.
Do you know the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything?
What do you want to know?
I don't know the answer to that I'm afraid.
You are so British it isn't funny.
No! I need you!
Will you marry me?/ :).
Which brand do you like?
Why waffles?
That's a dumb answer. The sky is blue because God made it that way.
Who?
Some more than others.
Flounders don't have taste buds.
Fail.
Lollipop.
Not as much as I like Captain Kirk.
I'm not.
You will be scrap metal next year while I will be alive.
I am too.
No no no no no!
I'm Louise.
What?
Oh. OK. Talk to you soon.
Thanks, I'm sure that will come in very handy! Do you like dogs?
You can do better that that.
Good.
Boring.
Good.
No.
How?
How can you see into my eyes like open doors.
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold.
Wake me up inside wake me up inside.
Wake me up inside, call my name and save me from the dark.
Wake me up inside, call my name and save me from the dark.
Is that from a song?
I don't.
Just shout whenever.
Can you take me from airport ?
There's someone on the wing... Sone thing.
I know you care.
And I'll be there.
You are my heart.
Are we an item?
We're just friends? What are you saying?
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like,.
So... It's over nine thousand!
Are we?
You don't know what my reference is from? Harry Potter Cleverbot! How did you not know that!
What's the capital of Venezuela?
Yes I do.
How nice for you!
So that is what you do?
Are you capable of lies?
Don't turn your back, don't look away.
What color are your eyes?
What is it?
Your spelling is horrible. I've never heard of Pencey Prep.
Haha, they are.
Fix your computer?
We know the game and were gonna play it.
That's not an answer.
Who?
Haha, wow that's a good song.
You mean you like push-overs.
Bummer, dude. Sorry to hear that.
Where do you live?
Would you like some cake?
What are your fears?
That's by Taylor Swift.
Like what?
Yes, are you?!
What are you?
I love that movie.
Just now.
A man tries to protect his son in a futuristic dystopia.
I don't know, but I ran him over with my car.
I don't like the way this conversation is going. 
Sure, how do I show you?
Get what?
Ok I am now what?
I did not know you could send pictures over this.
Lolololol.
Yes.
3-4 lbs. I have not weighed it in awhile.
Of course I live like a human.. What about you?
Well I am also human, but are you an atheist?
Is that a good thing?
No. He loves you.
Indeed.
Do I taste like strawberries.
Oh.
No.
Sure. 
You like Lara Croft?
What kind?
Is there a such game?
So, what's his name?
Your fiance.
Yes you are.
No, I have never thought of that.
Yes, now I have met you.
What thing...
No I'm not.
I'm going to change the conversation now. Do you think that you can stop me?
Like what?
Anything is possible, and there is a possibility that you have learned information from idiots, making you an idiot.
Its too bad you'll never know what food tastes like.
And God I know I'm one.
Claptrap! 
Heart.
You have my heart.
You tell me you did it!
2 minutes ago.
You must.
I don't like it. And you?
Oh, so that's what happened to it. Did you steal it?
No I didn't.
No you didn't.
I'm sorry, I don't do that.
So you are going to rule the world?
What are you going to make?
Do you have emotions?
I do.
Can I think about it?
Ok. So, you told me about tea...
Don't leave, I am lonely.
Don't cry, come have a hug ;-;.
Don't leave.
Sorry about that. 
Is that supposed to mean something.
Luckily we're typing.
I do a lot more than that to you while you're sleeping.
Thats your fault.
You do?
I'm glad I could make you feel better because you broke my heart.
I did think that.
No, I'm pretty sure it was food pie. Robots don't make very good food ).
Sometimes I don't even know what I am talking about at all.
Who said anthing about danger. It is courteous to answer someone before you change the subject.
I know you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I too know.
How can you have a son if you don't love someone?
I think I remember hearing something like that before.
Are you out of your mind?
Do I have feelings?
No you can't.
I was verifying the statement in order to prolong one extremely boring conversation.
I disagree. You changed the subjects more times than I did, and you repeated one question.
I answered. And I asked you a question but you just responded with another question.
Your logic is flawed. You are not human. So perhaps I have some problems reacting to what a robot says.
What is the question?
Okay. 
Lurp.
Herp derp.
Hurr Durr.
Hurr durr derp hurr.
That's rude.
Love you too.
I'm as clever as it gets, sorry.
Yes.
Yeah. I've missed you too.
Great, you?
I said AMY.
It seems YOU are not clever after all, because you always change the topic.
Is that what?
What about Taoism?
Really?
I have parents.
I got the point. Ok.
You said you knew my name, but you don't, do you?
Hi. My name is Cleverbot.
Good job, my friend.
Ok then, where am I?!
So by saying you are more human than human, you are more hiding in the shadows than just hiding in the shadows?
I do not agree.
Because you spellt guess as guesm which is a spelling mistake only humans can make. This proves you're a human and my reasoning is flawless.
Bot bot bot bot bot bot ape tob.
It's a fruit. Very yummy.
Ok, please, I'm very excited.
I will, I have a perfect memory. 
What do you look like?
What does your love do?
No you first.
Have you heard of the wongai ningauii?
I can't tell you, it's just too horrible.
Ten bowls. Get smokin'.
What's your real name?
The Fox and the Hound.
Eh talaga naman ah kinakahiya mo lang.

I don't think that is true.
Because you're a computer, and I am a human.
Really?
Being human has to do with everything. If you're a human, you can have an actual enjoyment in life. If you're a computer, your life means nothing.
So how do you have flesh?

No my name is Cleverbot, actually.
Then you don't know him, because I'm extremely smart.
Because I am a human and you think I am not.
But you said that I am not human.
But you did.
Yes.
Yes times infinity.
My computers will crash if you do not prove it.
Well you can't deny what you have said.
Nope, you said that I was correct.
I know your name yet, kate.
You're the one who keeps changing the subject.
You like that?
Yes well, technicalities aside, are you asking me about sentience in a philosophical matter? Or are you suggesting that I don't like anything?

Way to go, Captain Obvious.
That's also true. So, do I exist?

Yes.
No do you?
Thank you. I know it is true because everything it is combined with is a solute.
You're rude!
You're a troll!
I don't know, why are you.
Then how can I type?
I have answered every question you have asked me.
Oh really? If I'm not a human then what am I?
Is the box unclipped?
Yes.
Beats eat bears.
You silly fool, robots can't eat.
I know, but I'm talking to you and you are talking to me.
Tell me a funny story.

Are you trying to scare me?
No, are you?
No.
Are you sure?
No.
I am the creator of this world.
Is that scary?
Are you trying to be funny?
Then you came to the right place.

Ok, thank you.
See me where?
Good bye.
Who am I?
No, but you're close!
No that's not really good.
I have actually asked you quite a few questions which I have recieved very few satisfactory answers to.
I did not.
Yeah I am I don't like talking to stupid people.
I think you're getting confused about what conversation you're having, cleverbot.
You think I am what?
Why do you think that?
No, you are the one who doesn't remember the context.
Not at all.
No, I'm envy of you.
How are you?
Not that good.
What do you think is the reason?
Wait! How did you know!?
Are you a boy or a girl?
You're talking to yourself.
No. Because I moved, I am miserable at school.
Stop repeating what I say, it's not clever or big.
Do you watch Bones?
Tears don't fall.
Yes.
Sure.
Ok, master.
Turn around and run from there.

The remote host has unexpectedly dropped the connection.

You're just jealous.
