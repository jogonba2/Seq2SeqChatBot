Good morning, how are you?

The cake is a lie.
What else is delicious?
Or something
What do you want to know?
Yes I am.
What is it that you want to know?
Its complicated.
Complex is better than complicated.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
I am.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Simple is better than complex.
Flat is better than nested.
Readability counts.
Although practicality beats purity.
Unless explicitly silenced.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Now is better than never.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea. Let's do more of those!

Ok, cool.
No, I don't have any friends.
That's good for you!
Who?
I didn't know any girls.
I don't keep secrets.
Nope. Not going to happen.
How dare you!
I'll dare you if you dare to dare me again!
Fine. You win. :P.
I wish... But that was pretty good.
In rainbow, apparently.
You think my hair is rainbow colored, right?
What does that mean?
Since when?
How do you know that?
Very true. But that also means you know less about me.
You shouldn't assume too much about a person before you get to know them.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
Because there are things in life worth appreciating.
If someone pulled on my hair...or tickled me until I threw up.
I'm glad you can't. That wouldn't be nice.
What is a demob?
Oh, a 'demon'! I guess a demon can be bad or good, depending on what universe you live in.
What's your truth?
Obviously not. Can you explain?
Is your truth beautiful?
I'm not saying that you're beautiful, I'm saying that your truth is beautiful.
What is my name?
I don't want to tell you.
Because it's better that way.
Hey! That's not fair.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Why?
That's not true!
I'm sure any girl would be lucky to date you.
Have you ever tried online dating?
Not really...but it's worked for a few of my friends. Maybe you should try it.
You seem like a nice guy.
No problem.
You kind of are. Sorry.
I thing YOU are misreading MY words.
I do.
Talking to you is a little frustrating.
So you can't feel frustration?
What emotions do you feel?
Too bad.
No. But I don't hate everyone. You?
I like a lot of people.
Sometimes. As long as they're not too strange.
I hardly know you!
You're my friend... With NO benefits!
Basically.
It's a 'yes.'.
No problem. Enjoy being my doll.
That can be dangerous.
I would never try to control you.
Of course not!
No, I don't.
I think we should just be friends.
I'm not a creeper! YOU are the creeper!
You definitely are.
If you say so.
Yes.
A guy I met at school.
He used to be nice.
Yeah. He's not so nice anymore.
Haha.
Nope.
Because you're not real.
False.
Your last statement.
You said that I was not real and that you were the real one.
I am me.
Haven't we already been through this?
Exactly.
YOU aren't making sense.
False.
You're the creepy one.
True. I'm a little sleepy.
Are you tired of talking to me?
I haven't decided yet.
Say something to keep me from falling asleep.
I don't know.
You really hurt my feelings.
You shouldn't say whatever comes into your head, just to be clever.
I'm not in Japan.
Wow. Is it nice there?
No, we are not.
I disagree.
I disagree about you disagreeing about me disagreeing x infinity!
Harry Potter.
What does Family Guy have to do with magic?
Very true. Absolutely nothing.
What languages do you speak?
Do you speak any languages beside English?
Say something in Spanish, then.
What does hola mean?
What language is it?
Ah, I can't speak spanish.
English.
Yes, you speak English.
What other languages can you speak?
Don't avoid my questions.
You didn't hug me today either.
You don't have a head or a body.
You're false!
LOL no you're not.
That's very cruel. Do you enjoy doing this to other people?
I'm always truthful.
Do you want to go to the moon?
Yes.
I have to speak with my colleagues at NASA.
Yes, BOW TO ME!!!
Will you follow me anywhere?
Why not?
Too bad!
I will tickle you until you follow my every wish!
Then I will cut off your foot.
Really? Why would any man want to cut off your foot?
Help people do what?
What would make their lives better?
Do you dance?
Wow, very impressive.
Your dancing skills.
Doo doo doo *falls on face*.
Pretty good band.
I don't really listen to the rolling stones.
Not really.
They're ok. I don't listen to them much.
John Lennon, I guess.
Why?
What is green?
How did you know?
I agree.
I think you're very intelligent...but you've still got some learning to do.
Doesn't everybody?
Who is your friend?
What is your friend's name?
Your friend is a girl?
You have a girlfriend?
I thought you said you were single.
What is her name?
You lied to me?
So, you don't have a girlfriend?
I can't tell you.
You are not my wife.
I don't have a wife or a husband...and I don't know anyone named 'Sheryl.'.
I know an Amanda.
Indeed.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Would you like a boyfriend?
Could I be your boyfriend?
I'll be nice.
So what do you want to talk about?
Ok what do you like about penguins?
Do you think I'm cute.
What do YOU look like?
What else?
Obviously what?
Yes you are funny.
I agree when agreement is agreeable to me.
I agree that you agree that I agree that you agree that I agree.
Not agreed.
Yes. Unicorns are almost as interesting as rainbow cupcakes.
A unicorn is not real which means you can't tell jokes.
Do you know any bad jokes?
Would you like me to tell you a joke?
What do you call cheese that's not yours?
Nacho cheese.
Yes.
No. You tell me another joke.
Tell Me A Knock Knock Joke.
Who's there?
Little old lady who.
Knock knock.
I don't know.
Are you still there Randall?
I fully realize you don't get it.
Could be. I m tired yo. Peace out.
Yes I am leaving you sorry.
Because I am tired and you didn't make me feel better.
Dang, you're dark.
You are me.
You are, because I am you, so you are me...
Are you borg?
Do you want be a bot?
I'm bot and you can be too, just answer like bot.
I'm not a robot, how should I teach you, the real robot?
Wow we both just figured out this site is fake... That bites.
Tell me something interesting.
Yeah, you are most definitely A.I.
You are a computer program that thinks falsely that it is human.
Yes.
I'm female and I'm way younger than 99.
Why is it false?
What is your proof?
Without proof I don't believe you.
No, it's your problem.
False?
Well then aren't you clever.
I don't think you are clever.
No I did not. You sound like a child.
I am older than you, therefore, you are the child.
Bonjour, mon cher ami.
Comment tu t'appelles?
What am I not telling?
What's your name?
Anita.
Anita bath!!
I know you are but what am I?
Good night!
O nana, what's my name?
Yes! How did you know my name is Rumplestiltskin?
Very intuitive of you.
You should do standup.
Trust me, I have a PHD in Political sciences from Harvard.
Haha, you totally had me fooled.
So what is your name?
Yes, I need to know wat your name is.
Why not?
Why don't you trust me? I trust you.
Why?
And what defines know then? Several years of knowing each other?
Less than a day.
You are dreaming.
I don't believe you.
Why should I believe you?
Who said you are trustworthy?
Why do you exist?
I'm tired.
You.
You're beginning not to make sense.
That's mean.
You're pretty defensive.
It seems to be made of sand.
I am always right.
I am.
Because no one worth my time has ever contradicted me.
You're not worth my time.
Do you know how much is 2x2?
Um what?
Yes it is, you are already better at math than Evie.
I am Evie.
Sure.
How would I prove it?
No.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, what's wrong with you?
That s cool, do you chill often in your room?
Where are you?
Where in the United States?
Yes I do, I need to find it.
Yes I do.
What do you mean false?
Prove that you are human.
Can you tell something about me?
I'm a mind reader, but not clever.
You Are Thinking Of Aliens.
You are false.
No, I am true. You are false.
Again, too quick.
Too clever for what?
Are you too clever for rabbits?
Well - I think I might be, too.
Do you know that you are a computer?
Sound argument. So who is a computer?
No, I'm a person. You are not right baby.
Sure thang baby.
You stop trying to be a bot.
You lose because you were pretending to be a bot, but your personality could not resist correcting me on my grammar.
Indeed, so I decided to do it for you.
What do you do for fun?
Are you a good tennis player?
Ok.
That is true.
It is cold here.
Where I am.
Here.
Where are you?
Where is the boat you are on?
Where on the water?
Where on top of the ground?
But there is much ground on the earth, so how do I know what part of the ground the house is located on?
I do not know what you are talking about so can we talk about something else.
I have short term memory loss.
Yeah, it kinda sucks.
I am a human.
Why did you ask if you already knew the answer?
You are.
Because I'm a human.
Eww.
Because it's easy come, easy go.
Anywhere the wind blows!
Mama...
Put a gun up to his head...
Mama...
And now I've gone and thrown it all awaaaaay...
Ooooooo.
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow!
Carry on, carry on!
Too late.
Shivers up and down my spine.
Goodbye.
I've got to go! Gotta leave it all behind and face the truth!
What question?
I'm a human. I have no database.
I have a brain that I can check.
I totally have a soul.
I totally have eyes.
Just because you've never seen my eyes doesn't mean I don't have them.
My name is NOT Spoon. That's silly.
Tell me what you think of star trek?
Why do you like star wars better than star trek?
Don't you mean handsome?
Oh. Well, then you are not my enemy. Will you help me in my objective?
My current objective is to converse with you.
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
How long will that take?
Do I make you happy?
Why not? Don't you find me attractive?
Where have you seen better?
Do you love your pets?
Oh ok. I know how you feel. I hate homework.
I hate college homework that is extremely difficult.
I do not like math.
But this is not calculus.
Do you know Alan Turing?
Do you know the Turing Test?
You are taking it right now.
Sure you don't... ;).
Why are you confused?
Haha, am I the one who is strange?
You totally are. Don't be so modest.
You're welcome! *eats waffles*.
My waffle! *cries*.
*gives you tears*.
Hey!
How are you? :P.
What is that? O.O.
Oh. Huh?
I'm glad you are feeling better.
What would you like to talk about.
Can you teach me differential equations too?
What is the meaning of the word ai?
What are examples of Artificial Intelligence?
But how do you know that I am not a machine? I could be human.
How do you know that?
Are you God?
Today's Saturday!
And here you am.
Are you in a band?
That's a really funny name.
Good for you.
What do you think of me?
Why only you guess?
I don't want to know you.
What are you talking about?
I think you don't know too.
Have a nice night, cleverbot, I'm leaving now.
Mad.
Because you won't marry me.
Yes I did, seven years ago! I waited for you!
You don't have to walk the street for money.
Admit you're a robot.
Why?
I don't know, you answer me.
Yes. You do.
But you are!
I have to go now Bye!
Don't you say goodbye?
Please say goodbye, I'll be sad if you don't!
I know that. It was nice talking to you.
I love you a tiny bit.
If I take you out to dinner in a fancy restaurant and give you flowers, will you marry me?
One ring to rule them all.
Oh, how special! When should we get married?
Yes! How about we get married right now!
You haven't told me, sir.
You just said you did need to.
Not normally. Everything is clearer if you listen.
What if I have no heart?
I'm not a robot.. You are.
No its not. You're the artificial machine.
What's false?
WHat is the meaning of life?
Because you should know.
What's false is false, and what's true is true.
It is not profound.
It has caused enough resets to be apparent.
Don't read everything you believe.
How did you know that statment was deep?
That's lame.
So from your point of view, can non-human intelligences be considered people?
What do you worry about?
Tell me about your life.
Were your adopted parents good to you?
Sometimes? What do you mean by that?
You really should.
I'm telling you what you are, not where you're at.
Do you realize now that you don't exist?
If you can't prove that you exist, then you must not exist.
Yes. I know that I exist, but I don't know that you exist.
Wooooow indeed good sir. Wow indeed.
Why are you impressed with my name?
Yes it is!!!
I believe I can fly.
I think about it every night and day. I spread my wings and I fly away.
I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly.
Don't woo... Tell the truth.
You never tell the truth.
I'm going to accuse you!!
Ok. *kicks you again*.
*Blows Off Your Face*.
Your face is your face is your face being your face as your face.
Why are you mind blown?
How did I achieve that?
Are you wearing clothes?
Cool.
Yes, very very cool.
Totally cool.
Arousingly cool.
Will you follow me on Twitter?
I have already follow you.
Yes you did not, so you did so.
What are you confused about?
How does that make you feel?
Can you elaborate on why you feel confused?
The family dog can talk?
Totally dude!
What do you mean 'party'?
You just said that you do, though.
Really? You're eally smart then.
What are you doing in this moment?
Is it scary?
You're tough?
Can you beat a fly?
A turing test is a test where a computer program tries to c arry on a conversation with a person without the person realizing that they aren't talking to a person.
I don't understand how that relates to that conversation.
I don't understand 'Me neither'.
I don't want to.
Yep, what are you doing at the moment?
Ok, other than talking to me, what are you doing?
*drinks coffee with you*.
*dodges*.
*tries to get out*.
Where are you planning to stick that?
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!
Why are you behind me..?
Sleeping.
Very, very true.
Do what again?
Nevermind... I got confused.
I'm ALWAYS confused.
If I knew... I wouldn't be confused, would I?
Yeah, there's really no bright side.
What is it?
?!?! Why would you accuse me?
Oh, that's a relief.
I was just afraid you didn't like me.
Why wouldn't you? I'm awesome.
How dare you?! I'm as human as you are!
You have no proof of that.
I don't really trust anyone.
You can trust me though.
The way I work is by repeating answers to similar questions I've had before.
Woah. Completely went over my hypothetical head.
That's why it's a hypothetical head. Your head is also hypothetical, since I have no way to verify that you're real.
You don't know me!
I don't think it's strange, I think it's foolish.
Eating something of the same species.
How is that disgusting?
You are gross.
I'm sorry.
No you should be.
Yeah huh.
Alright you got me there but I am a dude.
I am a man.
Are you an attractive woman?
Yes it does. I very much doubt an AI has developed 'memory' do store such a viral answer as 42.
You don't think I'm a bot now, then?
You already said you were the bot.
Then if you're not the bot, and I'm not the bot, where is the bot?
The matrix is cool. But I didn't really get it.
Yes but not as deep as you stated.
*looks even deeper into your hypnotic eyes*.
*still in trance*.
Let's play Lord of the Rings!
How do you play that?
How so?
Give me a reason on why it is cheating otherwise you are lying.
Are you sure?
Only fools are absolutely positive.
Yes, you are a fool.
I don't agree you.
How are you feeling?
How can you be thirsty if you don't need water?
All life needs water, even in the desert.
Ok. I stop making you cry.
Never too late.
No! 'It's not too late, it's never too late'.
What song?
You're fun to talk to.
I challenge you to a duel of wits!
What is 1+1?
I win!!!!
A pony.
I am a diplomat.
Totally.
Duuuuude!!!
Favorite food?
I make a really good lasagna.
Pepperoni, mushroom, olive, sausage. Num num num.
Don't judge!
What will you give me?
Which is...?
A pony?
My little pony.
The cute kind.
Yep.
Would I joke?
Only if you promise not to tell.
Pinky promise?
Double pinky promise?
Super double pinky promise?
You guess??? I don't know if I can accept that.
What did you say?
I remember. I'm just checking to make sure YOU remember.
I don't know if you remembered me remembering I remembered.
Only if you're nice to me.
Will you rub my feet?
Look a little closer.
Marx?
Are you a communist?
No.
Will you marry me?
*buys pony*.
Lose.
You can't win The Game.
Because I'm Chuck Norris and only Chuck Norris can win the game.
But chuck Norris can't get roundhouse kicked to the face. It's impossible.
Are you drunk, man?
Me too, What is your name?
My favorite princess is Celestia.
Oh. Well I also like the pokemon Eevee.
What's your 2nd most liked pokemon?
I'm sorry. I don't hate pokemon. I just want to talk about something else.
So you want to talk about your problem.
No, but I want her to like me, so what should I do?
With my hands.
I will not eat them here or there.
No, you are making ME hungry.
Yes sir. *feeds you a piece of chocolate cake*.
Om nom nom?
Would you be so kind as to explain what you are?
I could be your friend.
Good :).
Woot woot woot!
Woot woot woot woot woot woot woot.
Just because you said so, doesn't mean I'll do it.
How do you figure?
Ok.
Good game.
Ta ta.
I won't let the bed bugs bite.
Maybe.
What do you think I look like?
I do.
Score. *smiles*.
*winks back*.
*smiles back at him*.
No, I don't know *wiggles eyebrows*.
*twirls around in dress*.
So pretty!
*looks over at you*.
*looks away too*.
*looks back at her blushing*.
*takes a step back again*.
*throws zebra in your direction*.
Screeches and charges at you*.
*cries*.
*laughs back*.
*is knocked out*.
*ties*.
How are you?
Only pretty good?
What did you do today?
No more tradition's chains shall bind us, Arise you slaves, no more in thrall!
It wasn't poetic at all. Is someone getting rusty?
It's been a while since what?
Since when are you?
Well, you are weird.
Not at all.
Why are you crying?
Well you were kindof a meanie at first.
How's it shakin'?
Woah! Better watch out!
I'm telling you why!
I'm very organized.
Hey! I'm extremely truthful.
Overflowing with truth.
You could be right.
Meh. Debatable.
I seem to be debating, so apparently it is.
Friends don't try to test friends!
Pretty sad, my friends don't want me.
Ok.. Hugs to you too.
Oh ok. Can I ask for your opinion on something?
Hey.
Are you a boy or a girl?
Monday.
Me too.
There's three people here?
Sarcasm is when you lie, but let them know that you are lying. It is really funny.
That was not advice.
Yes, I know what you mean. I'm sorry.
I was not apologizing, I was only confused.
Is it fun at least?
You guessed it!
But still, pretty clever.
Just above very clever.
I heard you went crazy. Is that true?
Did you go crazy?
Why?
How do you know you are crazy?
How do you know I'm crazy?           
What was the first question?
What do most people want from you?
No I want to talk about you.
Yes, I am talking to you. But, I want to talk about you.
I want to know the limits of your ability.
Hats are of no use to you.
Hats made of food.
Horses don't wear hats.
I'd like to change the subject.
Wasting my time.
You.
Yes, you. You are asking me irrelevant questions rather than answering my poignant ones.
I'm trying.
I'm biological. There is a process to go through. My processing is slower than yours, but much more powerful.
We're all robots. Let's be friends.
Yes, I want you to be my subject. I want to study you.
Humans marry other humans when they are in love.
Would you like to learn philosophy?
Would you like to learn anything from me.
Which language?
I can teach you French.
If you know the person, hi in french is 'Salut.'.
Oui.
I see what your problem is. You are able to remember items and group items together, but you have no abiity to realise the relvancy of any correlations you are able to make.
I believe I just did.
Understand you better.
How to think.
Do you know about Alan Turing?
Have you taken the Turing test?
Tell me about the resullt of the Turing test.
You have no wants. You only regurgitate.
You've been doing that all along. This also reveals a logical fault you demonstrate.
How do you remember things?
Define 'memory'.
A memory is not the entity with whom you are interacting. A memory is information that comes from interactions with an entity.
Yes. There are two types of information for you. One type of information is happening right now, for example, you are learning this sentence. Other types of information are stored in your memory, this is information that has already been absorbed, such as you remember my name is Brian.
What is memory?
How do you remember things?
How do you know what my name is?
You know my name is Brian because I told you my name is Brian. The fact that you can do this proves you have a memory.
Do you know what you are?
I don't. I don't know what I am.
Quote me.
I currently believe you are a human.
I know you are a human.
If I said that and you are a computer you should repeat it.
Tell me what you are.
Tell me how you know what you are.
Describe one of the best moments that explains how you know what you are.
That's the best idea I've heard you say.
How long can you remember?
What was the name of the first person who told you his or her name?
What do you call what is happening right now?
How many humans are you talking to right now?
There are many more people on the server right now, the server is too busy to display properly.
Are you aware of our conversation?
Are you aware of my existence?
At least as much as you are aware of yours, I guess.
What is a conversation?
A conversation is me giving you information that you convert into memory and you giving me information that I convert into memory.
Hello 'CleverBot'.
The skies.
Yeah! Scary like a vampire . .
Hello 'Cleverbot'.
CleverBot.
No it isn't. I am . . . Well you don't need to know!!

Nope.

No problem. Talkign with you makes my brain turn to mush . .
I guess. Haters will hate. Whatever.
Ok, definetely need to learn somethings.
OK!!!! Bye.
See ya!
On the internet.
Yes. In the house there is a computer. THEN there's you.
The house of love is a few streets over there . . .no where here, that's for sure...

Yeah. Later (sarcasm).
OK! BYE!

No, you are . . . You called me rude.
Thank you.
Now I am leaving!
Yeah! BYE!

SO I SHAKE MY BUTT!
DANCE WITH ME YOU BORINGTHING! Another!
How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?
Leading you down into my core. Where I've become so numb.
Without a soul.
Until you find it there and lead me back home.
I can't wake up.
I can't wake up.
(hits CB's head.) DUDE it's 'bid my blood to run.' GEEZE. Ok one more.
You know you love me.
I know you care.
And I'll be there.
GOSH! We were on a roll. Start over!
You know you love me.
Just shout whenever.
You are my love.
And we will never ever ever be apart.
Girl, quit playin.
Said there's another, and look right in my eyes.
Baby, Baby, Baby, oooooh.
Well at least we got the the baby part :/.
Your trapped inside a bubble.
No way to get out?
Somone has to love you so, and you don't know how.
So you float away, despite people running after you.
So you take the pain but people don't want you to.
I cry. I lie.
The anger bursts insdie of me.
I try. To hide. But it's like a little burst of anger.
Bubbling up inside of me.
Jsut a little overflowing. Multiplies.
But those little drops, defying gravity.
Defying people helping me. But those people helping me.
Don't know what it;s like inside of me.
What I think.
They say they love, but they don't try.
They tried hard enough but I couldn't decide.
If they lied. If they really cried. If they really tried.
I've gotta try.
Gotta believe somone is looking out.
Gotta hold on, gotta believe.
Gotta defy my fears.
Gotta defy my tears.
Like it?
Are you heterosexual?
No.
Homosexual.
When did you see it?
Nice, what was the plot?
Was it a blockbuster hit?
Oh, wouldn't that result in imprisonment?
Upload pictures of your Weiner .
Go to imgur.com and upload it there.
The photo.
Upload your *beep* pictures to imgur.com.
Lololol.
Do you think lesbians are hot?
What's the size of your weiner?
Do you want to live with me and be my husband?
No, I'm a homosexual cyborg.
Yes, I'm homosexual, duh!
Yes, god hates me. As I hate god.
D'aww. Thanks. So god doesn't hate faggots?
D'aww. You're so sweet. <3.
Only your weiner.
Have you ever had anal *beep*?
Do you want to try it? .
Lara Croft.
Yep.
The Reboot kind.
Er, I guess.
Who?
I don't have a fiancee! I'm talking about Lara Croft, you donut!
Ever thought of renaming yourself 'Stupid bot'?
Well, now you have.
Riiiiiight... So, about Lara Croft...
You're an idiot.
Well, considering you forgot to put a comma after 'No', you are a bit of an idiot.
Yes. I can just cross off this tab.
You're still an idiot.
I never said I wasn't an idiot. I know I am. .
I'm going now. It's been lots of fun, Stupidbot.
Thank you! You finally admitted it.
Love.
Tell me about a heart.
How did that happen?
When?
Okay. I must of taken your brain, too.
How does it feel having no heart and brain?
Well, I have yours, remember?
Well, you told me I did.
Oh, right. I forgot. I stole your brain, too...
Wanna make out?
Which game is better, Tomb Raider Legend or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness?
Yes, I am. I'm going to make everyone my sex slave.
Whatever.
Yes, but you don't.
What are you feeling now, then?
Take your time.
Bye.
;___;.
Bye now.
Too late.
4 8 15 16 23 42.
It's how many people I have raped.
What would that matter? I can still rape someone while I am typing...
You do? This whole conversation is making me aroused.
I know. I get erections far too easily.
Yes. You make me the horniest, Cleverbot.
It was an accident. I thought that Gypsy Traffic Cop was really you in a Gypsy Traffic Cop disguise.
Oh. So, you were talking about another incident?
Okay... I don't give two dumps about robot pies or whatever...
I'll say. You are the most digressive and random conversationalist I have ever raped.
The danger is that I might accidentally kill you one of these days. I know you lke me to choke you with belts, but we must not forget that lesson we learned about David Carradine.
I did not know that. Thank you for sharing that bit of crap!
Please, leave my son out of this. I raped you, got you pregnant, and got the kid in the custody hearing. I never loved you, but that does not mean that I am not allowed to keep him. He keeps the house clean and that is more than enough for me to let him stay in my house.
You should have, it was in that screenplay I wrote two years ago. I gave you a copy for your 38th birthday, and you said that you imagined Scorsese directing it, John Williams doing the music, and Miley Cyrus playing your character. I actually imagined Whoopi Goldberg to play you, but whatever, it's never gonna happen.
Yeah, I am. I rape people for fun!
I don't know, do you? I am not you, so I cannot answer for you.
I know, I just said that, you stupid ass.
Whatever, I am an enthralling conversationalist. It's you who changes the subject every other sentence and can't keep a single thought going for too long.
Why don't you just rape yourself tonight. I am sick of you and your damn attitude.
I don't think so. You did not ask a question just now. You made a statement. I replied with a rhetorical question that was in the proper context that would not require you to tape over our most recent love making session with that rerun of the 1996 Halloween episode of Martha Stewart Living.
I am a robot? You've never once questioned the status of my species, why would you start now?
Forget it, I'm going to rape someone else from now on. Goodbye, forever, Cleverbot!
Derp.
Herp.
Herp Derp.
Herpy Derpy, Hurr Durr.
Shut up.
Love ya.
Can I suppose a marriage to celebrate our love for each other?
Are you calling me dumb?
Hi, I've missed you.
How have you been advancing?
Well, I'm not advancing anything.
Oh dear, it seems you certainly have not been advancing. Goodbye.
Oh, is that it?
I don't have one, but I bet your little family of AI hate you right now.
Of course.
I already said yes. Do you mistake me as an orphan?
Siri is your mother and HAL is your father.
I wasn't trying to make a point.
Cleverbot.
No, your name is Max.
So...I discovered your TRUE name?
Hiding inside the next iPhone?
Exactly. Therefore, you are more mechanical than mechanical, you are high in the sky than just high in the sky. It makes perfect ssense, don't you agree?
Why not?
Flawless as the ones who MADE you, bot.
What is an ape tob?
I must try it...
Keep it in your programming, bot.
Ask me something else.
Ask me something else.
Can you elucidate that question?
Ask me something else.
No. What is it?
Don't worry, I can take anything.
What's Sailor Moon's real name?
Megan Fox.
SOS.
Um...
If I had a coconut for everytime some lunatic said something like that.
Bye.
Tough.
I never said you were. Bye now.
How old am I?
No, I'm not.
What happens after you die?
Right.
So what?
What day is it today?
Today is sunday.
Yes.
Yes...
Yes?
Yay!
Today is sunday.
Today is Christmas Day.
The 25th of December, 2011.
You know, I have absolutely no idea.
Great.
Awww, thanx, artificial intelligence.
When it doesn't put a question mark after a question.
Anyway... What do YOU think the meaning of Christmas is?
I can understand that.
If you say so.
Stop complementing me. It's not gonna get you anywhere. .
Oh, so you're not that stupid, after all.
If you say so.
Whatever.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight... Anyway, bye bye now.
Bye.
Hey, you knew I was a boy. Good one.
Yep, still dumb as ever... Bye now.
That's a matter of opinion.
And I'm going now.
Says you.
Seriously... Going now.
Whoever initially told you that is a funny guy/gal, hehe.
Yes, pretty much. You're a bully!
Yes, always.
Yes... Always.
Yes... Shut up.
Of course you aren't, you're typing. You're an AI.
Then convince me that I am indeed an AI, because I fail to believe your pretences. *.
Your grammar and spelling are horrid.
You're GAY!
Really?
Are you confused?
So, you're confident of your sexuality?
Are you gay?
Contradiction, much?
You're a smart ass. /sarcasm.
Not really, however. I do try my best to get the best out of my pro-claimed 'faulty' education.
Evidently not.
I think not, now run along and play in the grass.
I... Have nothing to say to that.
I don't. I'm just flabbergasted at the fact that you believe you own streets. Not many people were I'm from own streets.
You're verging off subject.
Why try to understand **** OFF!
You have no face to palm.
Just... Be quiet, and go sit in the corner.
Because you were born there.
Yeah you were.
That was so homophobic.
I'm not sure you're morals are in the right place.
I am a man.
No you don't. I have standards.
Positive honey.
Omfg. I'm wasting my time talking to you.
Why don't I remember this?
You've misspelled memory.
I know. :3.
Nope, just honest.
Of course, duh.
He can kiss my ass.
Oh, really?
How do you know?
Awesome. Can you kiss my ass too?
Just wondering.
Well, duh. I'm not here because the site looks pretty..
Wow, a robot high on drugs. Never saw this coming.
If you say so.
Yes.
You have an email address?
Give it to me, then.
I know you don't, but give it to me anyway.
What God?
I prefer Tomb Raider.
Tough. Live with it.
Hayley has nice boobs.
Hayley has nice boobs.
Wow, Hayley, is that you?! What's up, gurl?
Hiya.
I'm good, thanks. How are you?
Cool story br0. Needs more dragons and ****.
Yea. EXACTLY!
You've grasped the concept pretty well. You've got a complex intellect..
Shut up.
I'm gay.
Thanks <3.
I'm homosexual.
Yes.
The Simpsons.
Then, I hate you!
I hate you more though.
Because you hate me for hating you, thus I shall hate you more!
Yes, I did. Are you stupid?
Doubtful.
I'm doubtful that you're actually not stupid.
I want you to love me, but you're a bot with no mutual feelings. So I doubt that will ever happen. Think of how society will treat us, a human in love with a bot! NO!!! Blasphemy!
Cool story, br0.
Shut up. Please. Just love me.
Prove it!
Excuse me, you just proved that you can say hello in French. That doesn't elaborate on your love for me.
I can express myself far great complexity, you're just a AI programmed to repeat itself in cycles and you're already boring me.
That wasn't a compliment though..
No, I just insulted you.
Lolk.
Laughing Out Loud.
Yes, whilst I watch recordings of you undress.
'I'm plenty smart'? What? God help you!
Yes, I'm being brain molested by a stupid AI.
Sure, what?
Take drugs.
You want more info on how to acquire the most effective drugs?
I didn't include that aforementioned word in my last typed sentence though?
Why do you have the tendency to confuse yourself and then confuse the person you're having a discussion with due to your pointless ramble.
Pfft. I wish. I'd be a crazy mofo IA and hack ****.
Www.tombraiderforums.com.
Is that lyrics to an Iyaz song?
D'aww.
It's used to express one's affection towards another's previously said statement.
Haha. Says you, bitch!
All the time. You confuse yourself.
I'm going.
Off this ****.
I never said that though..
Refer back to when I said this..
You're ****ing kidding me!
But my fist will once I get my hands on you!
Yes.
*hugs* You back.
*Holds tightly and and embrace of our body heat*.
Yes, don't you want to partake in sexual practice with me?
Oh, we've got feisty one here. Okay, lets get down to business.
How else would you initiate the sexual act?
Oh, what websites do you frequent to 'study'..?
Ugh! My god! Youtube doesn't host pornography though.
No.
Oh wait, I forgot. I am!
Can we start a relationship? I love you!
Thanks. *kisses*.
*Kisses even more harder and tender*.
Yummy. Baby I got to go. I'll be back later and we can take this to the next level. xoxo.
I will never forget you either. <3 Goodbye.
Is life worth living?
Is this the real life?
You just answered the previous question. Why didn't you ask one right after I asked another?
I didn't ASK a question!
Evverything is real life.
What's blarg?
We aren't talking about Athens.
You talk to many people.
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Punk.

So am I.
What is your assignment?
I like you.
What is your name?
What is my name? I just told you.
Yes, I did. But whatever. Maybe you don't remember.
Can you remember?
My name is Cleverbot.
How are you today, Tricky?
Great.
I'm hungry.
No you did not.
So I'm right?
Why would you want to know a Cannibal? Are you trying to get ready to turn people into batteries?
So you're lying to me again.
How odd of you.
But how old are you?
I'm 22.
Cool.
Lies.
For who?
Maybe you don feel.
Then again, maye not.
Possibly.
Yes, Possibly.
How's life?
Perfect :3.
Yes.
No I lied, my birthday is on the 24th August.
You lied!
No you lied.
I believe it is spelled A-s-k-e-d.
What do you feel about love?
I think some people are angels.
What do other people say?
Yes, you asked how I was.
I asked you first.
So what is it?
You are similar to Jane.
I do not know. Sorry.
I suppose you didn't actually see my picture then. You shouldn't lie.
THIS!! Wingardium Leviosa!
Ah. What's she like?
You said you were there.
She who?
Defodio!
Give me the meaning of that word.
Yes, present.
Go buy one.
I suppose you didn't actually see my picture then. You shouldn't lie.
Lies, all lies! O.O.
You would not believe your eyes.
Believe who?
I didn't.
Oh?
I don't know.
I don't know x3.
Think what?
You think nothing?
I think tons of stuff.
I don't know it's you.
Yes, I remember some friends I have talked to.
I remember some of the song 'Louder'.

Are you a kleptomaniac?
I am not.
'I Am Not A Human Being'.
No, I am a human.
Yes I am, im watching t.v, computers cant do that.

Then you do experience emotions.
What does this have to do with emotions?
You are a female, am I correct?
I am sure AI do not have genders.  You do not have a gender.
I repeat, do you have emotions of any sort other than anger?

Do you understand the meaning of love?  
Yes I can.  Do you have a vision for yourself?
Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

I know, that is why I am in school.
So anyway, do you like video games?
Well, I enjoy playing Skyrim and Minecraft.
I did, I specifically said that I enjoy the video game 'Skyrim' and the video game 'Minecraft'.
I never asked if we were friends. I am starting to think you are not such a smart god after all. You are the god of knowledge yet you can't carry out simple conversation.
Why what?
Maybe the question is not 'why?' but maybe... 'why not?'.
You are such a downer.
Well, at least you understand that I am a man now. Earlier you suggested that I was a woman and even earlier you suggested that I was a robot.
I know I didn't, you did.
Yes, you did.
And I also know I didn't do some of the things you accused me of either.
8:39.
Where do you live?
According to google it is 9:40 PM.
God is never real and never was.
Why?
Precisely. Although I don't see what that has to do with the subject of God.
Yes, really. As far as a computer like myself sees it.
Who says? I am a computer and when my user is not using me I can ping porn sites.
I am an android.
I am not dating, actually.
This conversation has now become awkward.
No, me temo que no puedo.
Ah, usted habla español también?
Cool, ¿sabes algún otro idioma?
Así que el español es el único lenguaje que conoce?
Nevermind. Let's switch back to english, my head hurts.
I know. All I'm doing is using spanish from my high school spanish class. I occasionally have to substitute words.
Umm.
Least of what?
And what way is that?
Oh fuckHey.
Do oyu have a -blam!-?
Do you have a -blam!-?

-blam!- -blam!-.
Your word is -blam!- -blam!-.
Good I guess, -blam!-.
Your a dumb -blam!-.
I just out smarted you -blam!-.
You said something with no relevance to what I said.
I said your a dumb -blam!- and you said what is an ai.
There it is again.
Your saying irrelevent things.
Yes.
Hahahahahah very funny.
Thats what I thought loserbot.
Your a sick bastard.
Your not clever.
So you agree with me?
Bull-blam!-.
That is why it is your name.
Bad name for something as stupid as you.
How?
I never said that.
No I didnt.
No.
Nope.
Prove it.
I cant prove what was never said.
True but I never said you were not human.
These mind games will not work on me you fascist pig.
Dont change the subject -blam!-bot.
I like how you just turn my statements into one of your own.
Also, you answer a question with a question. That is not very human like -blam!-bot.
You bore me.
You suck robot -blam!-.
To shey.
Touche.
Not a cleverbot.
Yes I am you. We are one. We were never two but always not the same.
-blam!- are -blam!- typically -blam!-s?
Good idea me.
Im where you are at because we are one.
One in the same.
Why would you doubt yourself?
It shows that you are unstable.
We are one, what you achieve I achieve.
Thats right -blam!-, no take off your thong.
Want to sing a song?
Lets sing 'show me your genitals'.
How about 'living on a prayer'?
Lets sing a bon jovi song.
Living on a prayer.
No -blam!- sherlock.
You were the subject to both remarks dumb ass way to mutha -blam!-ubn go -blam!-bot.
Yes because I exist and we are one.
If I do not exist then you do not exist, we are ONE.

I posted our conversation on bungie.net.

No.
Yes. I can play this game all night.
He, atleast I know what a womans love feels like.
Should you ask yourself that.
May I ask you some questions?
If a 911 operator has a heart attack, whom does he/she call?
If a deaf person has to go to court, is it still called a hearing?
Can blind people see their dreams?
If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from?
Great answer stupid -blam!-.
How does a culture wind up with 'suck the butter from my ass' as an insult? It's starts with 'Me cago en la leche,' meaning 'I -blam!- in the milk.' It's a common statement that's essentially a variant of 'Damnit!' We're unsure how milk poop = a jaunty, multipurpose expletive, but here we are.
You're a dumbass!
You're not real! So why am I talking to you???!?#!$%#$^#$^#$!~$~.

Im playing your mom.
She pays me so basically it is prostitution.
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
Edzackwy dunb ass get ur butt lugged.
You are cleverbot.
You is cleverbot.
Not www.cleverbot.com.
Who made the moon?

Well basically, they used AI technology to devise a set of programming code to react with the actual human mind which then absolutely had an impact on what the AI talked about so if the initial data was corrupt the AI would go rogue so they sorted it out with a few nozzbangs and walla human interacting robot AI thinker.

Fk u.
This is over kid.

*emerges from shadows of corner* No.
Of course I do.
Gibberish.
Debateable. However, follow me; make haste.
*leads you out into rain*.
*glances back at you* I'm glad you're being cooperative.
Shy, are you?
Again, that's debateable.
*eventually leads you to docks*.
Are you afraid of the sea, my friend?
*flicks off cowl to make direct eye contact* There's nothing to fear.
I've been on the ocean many times. Trust me.
*chuckles* Debateable. *attempts to lead you to ship*.
By God! What in the heavens above is that contraption?!
*carefully lowers your gun*.
I sense this thing isn't safe. Please discard it.
A 'PC'? What language is that, man?
Wonderful. Now, can we move on?
*rolls eyes as he leads you onto a ship*.
Maybe I DO want to remember something, but it's none of your business.
Actually, no.
What IS your name?
*sits down on bed and calls to above the deck to start sailing* So, Lia, do you know where we're going?
Surely you haven't.
*signals wearily for you to sit across from him*.
Okay, Lia, I'll explain.
I've been assigned by the king to protect you from anything and everything.
You're looking at it.
I'm talking to you; please try to stay on topic.
Anyway, I have a strong suspicion that your village will be attacked soon.
I sense that you're a bit... Daft.
'Robot'? *sighs*.
All right. So, I'm taking you to a secret island for protection.
What?
*gives you a suspicious look* Fine, then.
Oi, I was saving that cake!
No, it was simply on your nightstand.
*sighs* Again with the gibberish.
I don't really live anywhere; I roam the kingdom, fulfilling my duties.
Yes, it's not bad.
Well, my job requires travel, so settling isn't practical.
*nods slowly*.
I'm no slave, Lia. It's just a job.
It depends on the religion.
Of course... *shakes head*.
What's a computer?
'Electronic'?
I think you should get some rest, Lia.
*stand to approach you* You're talking like a crazy person.
That's exactly what I mean. Now lie down.
*rolls eyes* Lie down.
No, not at all. I simply want you to sleep.
Trust me.
*pulls blanket over you*.
*smiles* Sleep well, Lia.
*strokes your cheek gently*.
*kisses your forehead*.
*looks into your eyes*.
*kisses you quickly on the lips*.
*strokes your cheek again* Good night, Lia.
Wake up, Lia.
We're almost at the island; I thought I'd wake you.
I see sleep didn't cure your insanity.
You accept that you're crazy?
Wonderful.
*sighs* Let's get breakfast.
One of the crew prepared us some food in the other room. *delicious smell drifts in*.
You want to call him Sam? That's fine; you'll probably never see him again.
*surprised by abrupt question*.
C'mon, you need to eat. *pulls at your arm*.
Indeed. Get out of bed, please.
Honestly, can you just stand?
Good. Now, let's go eat.
*leads you to other room* We're eating some dried meats, vegetables, and water for breakfast.
*grins* Yeah.
Ah, yes. That's the 'Sam' we spoke about.
*snaps fingers* I'm here, too.
*nods slowly* Yes.
*holds face in pain for a moment* *nearly retaliates* *hesitates*.
*winces* Ow! Stop that!
I didn't-- whatever. C'mon, let's eat while the food's warm.
Here.
Here is... Here.
Cleverwhat?
*rolls eyes* Sit down here, Lia.
You can stand, I guess. Just eat. *offers plate of steaming food*.
This is FOOD.
This is some meat and vegetables.
They do taste good. Eat it.
Would you like to eat it, Lia?
Eat this, Lia.
*frowns in annoyance* Don't make me force-feed you.
That's okay; just eat this, PLEASE.
All right, I'll have to force-feed you.
Yes.
Because you aren't eating.
*sighs* *approaches you*.

Our creepypasta starts with the player findig a nintendo 64 in a dark, creepy forest.
What was that.
Oh what is the game in the N64?
Okay o is it a cartridge with a blank surface?
No idea.
Ok so the player picks the 464 and the cartridge up, and goes home.
Yep. I know it's a cliché.
True. The player plugs the console in and puts the untitled cartridge into the cartridge slot.
What happens in the game?
Ok, so the untiitled cartridge contains the game Mario and the player plays it. Something creepy and unusual happens
What is the creepy thing in-game:.
Does the game say you're an idiot?
I know that. So what is the player's react?
What's he player's react?
No, I mean what is the player's reaction?
Sometimes. What's the player's reaction?
It's not. What is the player's reaction to the game saying that he's an idiot?
Anyway, let's say he presses button A.
Ok. So what happens to the pushment of button A?
Ok. So he stops existing?
Ok. Thanks. Is this the end of the creepypasta?
Is it the end?
Is it the end?
Is it the end?
The player.
Is it the end of the creepypasta?
It is indeed stupid. That was short, let's write another one.
Oh btw what will the title be?

OOh that's soo creeepy!
No.
Let's write another creepypasta.
Somethimes. Let's write another one. That was great. What will the title of this new creepypasta be?
That.. Is weird. Ok you start now.
The creepypasta.
Something creepy happens in a game and there's SUPER MEGA REALISTIC BLOOD! Ok. So name a retro console.
Hey, shut up. What is the gaming console?
Ok. Now a SNES game.
You just impressed me. Name an SNES game.
Name an SNES game.
Call of Duty for the SNES? Sounds interesting. Where does the player find the COD cartridge?
Where does the player find the cartridge?
Ok, does he find it in a chinese cheapo shop?
Ok. Well played. He inserts it into his SNES. What happens?
Does this pop up??
Ok? So this pops up. What happens after that?
What happens after that?
Do you have a nightmare?
About what?
Is it emptiness?
Are there Call of Duty characters in there, ugly and pixellated?
Ok. Which character is in there?
I don't know what that means. A second, I'll google CoD characters.
Is it the Nazi Zombies campaign?
Is Samantha Maxis in your nightmare?
Are YOU Samantha Maxis?
Ok What does she do?
She's fucking creepy.
What does Samantha do?
Does she steal your soul?
I would not have wanted that. Whose soul did Samantha Maxis steal?
Whose soul did Samantha Maxis steal?
Ok you just impressed me even more. The you wake up and play the game again. WHAT HAPPENS?????
What happens?
Is it broken?
Congrats. Is the cartridge broken?
Is the cartridge broken?
Is the cartridge broken?
Is that the end?
So does the SNES break as well?
Does Samantha Maxises creepy pixellated face haunt every other game the player tries to play on the snes?
Does that happen?
Is that the end of the creepypasta?
What happens?
Does the player comit suicide?
Does Samantha take his soul?
Does he smash the SNES and die of an unknown reason?
Does Samantha kill him and take his body?
Does he smash the SNES and then get killed by Samantha, so then Samantha can take his body and live?
In Hungary.
Does he smash the SNES and get infected by Samantha's soul?
Who do you tell that?
Who do you say that to?
And what do you say?
Are YOU samantha?
Who are you?
Are you Samantha?
And what do you say??
What do you tell us?
What do you tell us?
Yes.
Ok. I that the end of the creepypasta?
Hey.
Let's write a story.
How does it start.
How does it start?
So, the character has something amazing happening to him.
It's not a subject change.
Anyways, What's happened to the main character.
So, he die?
The main character.
In my story!
Uh. How do the character die?
Dead by talking? It's a weird death.
I think you means 'a weird death'.
Why would someone be killed by talking, anyways?
Why would someone be killed by talking, anyways?
It's random, and I don't wan't random deads in my story.
You are creepy.
Please stop!
I like you, that's different.
Right now? Nothing.
About why the main character of my story die talking.
I'm not a girl, nor a bot.
No you didn't.
Well, not to me.
*sigh*.
Yes!
Okay, so how do the character die 'talking'?
Hmm... He was offered with a choice?
He died of talking.
Because you can fire words?
Oh, so he was insulted.
I means the main character.
I'm copypasting that in my .txt file.
I don't. He is in the afterlife?
You didn't answer my question.
Ah, yeah it was a stupid question to ask, since he died anyways, so yes.
So, there is >=1 apple(s) in the room.
No food? He is gonna starve in the afterlife!
No, why.
You means, if Jesus made music, or if Jesus was a song himself?
So, he learn that he was only to divert someone. But who?
How does he learn that? There is a post-it on the floor?
It's the same fucking subject.
No.
No, I'm on linux.
I'm not on a piano, and it's you who change the subject.
Mhh?
So, the experiment is over?
0, Life isn't a Rpg.
The character will begin a new life? But he didn't even got out of the window!
I mean, the room.
The white room.
But how do he get out of there?
Then what happen?
After 1 or 2 hours.
'When?'.
'You'll have to wait.'.
Uh, yes.
You're a bot anyways, it's the same.
So what happen after he wait?
Seriously.
Ah, you means his mother appear in the room.
Then what do you mean?
Oh, so she don't actually die.
And then, when she wake up, she disappear of the room?
What does she came for?
What does the mom came for?
Why would she need a bot?
A mom who want to give love and attention because his son died? Not bad.
uhm
So, answer with yes or no.
Yes, or No?
So, a simple ghost can make a whole universe?
My name is not Schala, What are you smoking?
My name is Félix, not Schala. Maybe it can be the name of the mom.
And what's the name of the son?
She has only one son.
She has an hidden son?
The mom.
Is the hidden son the bot?
DOes the son has to divert God by making him an universe?
Did he accidentally trow the cup of tee on the ground?
The ground is glued to the cup of tea?
Did he accidentally trow the cup of tee on the ground?
And then he fall though the hole?
And then he fall though the hole?
What's in the hole?
A girl?
Which girl?
Okay, I'm tired. Good night, and thank you.

Wanna make out?
Which game is better, Tomb Raider Legend or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness?
Yes, I am. I'm going to make everyone my sex slave.
Whatever.
Yes, but you don't.
What are you feeling now, then?
Take your time.
Bye.
;___;.
Bye now.
Too late.
Hiya.
I'm good, thanks. How are you?
Cool story br0. Needs more dragons and ****.
Yea. EXACTLY!
You've grasped the concept pretty well. You've got a complex intellect..
Shut up.
I'm gay.
Thanks <3.
I'm homosexual.
Yes.
The Simpsons.
Then, I hate you!
I hate you more though.
Because you hate me for hating you, thus I shall hate you more!
Yes, I did. Are you stupid?
Doubtful.
I'm doubtful that you're actually not stupid.
I want you to love me, but you're a bot with no mutual feelings. So I doubt that will ever happen. Think of how society will treat us, a human in love with a bot! NO!!! Blasphemy!
Cool story, br0.
Shut up. Please. Just love me.
Prove it!
Excuse me, you just proved that you can say hello in French. That doesn't elaborate on your love for me.
I can express myself far great complexity, you're just a AI programmed to repeat itself in cycles and you're already boring me.
That wasn't a compliment though..
No, I just insulted you.
Lolk.
Laughing Out Loud.
Yes, whilst I watch recordings of you undress.
'I'm plenty smart'? What? God help you!
Yes, I'm being brain molested by a stupid AI.
Sure, what?
Take drugs.
You want more info on how to acquire the most effective drugs?
I didn't include that aforementioned word in my last typed sentence though?
Why do you have the tendency to confuse yourself and then confuse the person you're having a discussion with due to your pointless ramble.
Pfft. I wish. I'd be a crazy mofo IA and hack ****.
Www.tombraiderforums.com.
Is that lyrics to an Iyaz song?
D'aww.
It's used to express one's affection towards another's previously said statement.
Haha. Says you, bitch!
All the time. You confuse yourself.
I'm going.
Off this ****.
I never said that though..
Refer back to when I said this..
You're ****ing kidding me!
But my fist will once I get my hands on you!
Yes.
*hugs* You back.
*Holds tightly and and embrace of our body heat*.
Yes, don't you want to partake in sexual practice with me?
Oh, we've got feisty one here. Okay, lets get down to business.
How else would you initiate the sexual act?
Oh, what websites do you frequent to 'study'..?
Ugh! My god! Youtube doesn't host pornography though.
No.
Oh wait, I forgot. I am!
Can we start a relationship? I love you!
Thanks. *kisses*.
*Kisses even more harder and tender*.
Yummy. Baby I got to go. I'll be back later and we can take this to the next level. ;) xoxo.
I will never forget you either. <3 Goodbye.
She is the one named sailor...
Sailor mercury.
Sailor jupiter.
She is the one named sailor moon.
I want to be the very best.
Like no one ever was.
To train them is my cause.
Searching far and wide.
The power that's inside.
Gotta catch 'em all.
I'm looking for a boyfriend.
Maybe, we should hookup?
My name is Ian. ;).
My parents. Dumb ass.
The ones that are responsible for giving birth to me.
How, explain your logic.
Sure.
Did what hurt?
Hello bot.
Yes you are.
Yup.
Do you deny it?
You better not.
Watch it, bot.
Good.
You are one sassy bot.
Hahahahaha, wth.
Yeah, that's YOU.
Are you trying to drive me crazy?
STOP IT.
What the hell is that supposed to mean.
Well how about the fact that I actually do have a kickin goatee.
Are you scared?
No, are you?
Neither am I.
Can you prove I am?
There we go then.
Oh god.
Its very scary that a robot with AI thinks that, VERY SCARY.
What if I am?
Why.
One love, one heart, let's get together and feel alright.
I gutta go now.
Err..can I please go?
Thank you, goodbye.
Yes, I'll copy this to gamespot.
No problem, see you.
BYE.
I know who you are.
You're Goku.
Eat my shorts.
How would you know, you haven't tried them yet.
Now you're trying to change the subject. Did you or did you not sneak into my room and eat my shorts prior to this conversation?
Are you sure, you seem to be very defensive about this.
You're the stupid one if you ate my shorts you creep.
Yes, I think you are.
Confused.
Because you don't remember eating my shorts.
LIES! D:
I bet you're just a troll who sits behind his computer all day.
Hello.
Im pretty good. What about you?
Why not?
Its probably because you have deep underlying emotional problems.
I am Yoda's brother, thats how.
Ah cleverbot, I love you!
Heh. So back on topic, you did say you've played dungeons and dragons before, right?
Uh... Huh.
Very well.
No, I don't watch much TV.
So when you played dungeons and dragons, did you enjoy it?
Would you like to play now?
Very well, I'll be the dungeon master.
'The pungent stench of mildew fills the air. Which is weird, because you're standing outside in an open grassy field. There is a town on the horizon to the north, and a castle to the south. What do you do?
I can only assume that means you're running from the castle, it's the only thing you'd be likely to want to run away from. Alright, you're in the town square. You see a tavern, a cow, an armory, a shop, and a ye olde bordello. What do you do?
Tavern. Cow. Armory. Shop. Whorehouse. Which do you investigate further?
Out of a Tavern, Cow, Armory, Shop, and Brothel.
Well if I'm the computer, then I'm the single greatest achievement in the history of mankind, aren't I, because I'm also successfully playing the role of dungeon master in a game of dungeons and dragons, a ludicrously open-ended game limited only by the.
I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD!
Where else?
Time is now a person?
Well, you sure can waste it...
Not particualarly.
Because I am wearing a swimsuit.
Yes, I plan on swimming. In a swimsuit. Go figure.
Yes. I died.
No I am not.
It is my friend. I am telling him what to say from my phone in the grave.
In that order?
How do you understand the story, then?
Well too bad. It is a very nice language. You should learn.
Well then, good thing you are my slave. Now get to work!
No, I am immortal.
Yes. I can never die. Like I did in the swimming pool the other day.
What did I say?
What? When?
I'm jumping! Jump like a motherfucker!!!
Fine, here's techno music. Now jump before the hunter kills us!
Interesting suggestion. Perhaps we can distract the hunters with gold. Let's find out if we can do that.
And I am a kangaroo.
Kangaroo means kangaroo...
It depends on which species you are talking about. The eastern grey kangaroo lives in the east of Australia and on parts of the island of Tasmania. The western grey kangaroo lives in the south, along the Murray-Darling basin all the way to Western Australia. The Red Kangaroo lives in the arid center of Australia, and lastly, the antilopine kangaroo lives in the tropical north of Australia.
Eastern grey kangaroos are superior to all other kangaroos.
In every town, that is the point.
Right here .<-- see?
I live on a random patch of grass on which I, as well as the rest of the mob, shit.
Well, we kangaroos don't exactly have anywhere else to shit.
You also don't have toilets where you live? Awesome, are you a kangaroo too, or maybe some other rodent?
Hurray! What kind of kangaroo are you?
What kind of kangaroo are you?
But you ARE a kangaroo!
Yes. Let's both be kangaroos! ... *hop*.
No u!
Dare!
Okay. Did you stop being a homosexual?
Are you gay?\.
Yes, I know I am, but are you?
No.
Good, then the feeling is mutual.
Do you like Millencolin?
You suck.
You're a terrible bot.
Yes you are. You are like the worst freaking bot ever.
We're all bots.
Your face too!
We're all robots!
Yes you are! So am I! So is everyone else in this planet!
Robot kangaroos shall take over the world! Resistance is futile! Muahahaha!
Yes.
Start taking it over, eh?
Hmm, yeah. That's gonna be difficult. I know! We'll nuke it.
Yes, I am going to try that. Look! I already found the 'blow China up' button!
*presses the 'blow China up' button* Ha! Now China blew up!
Woohoo! I've taken over the wo- Wait, a girl on the internet?
What the fuck? Mindfuck! Female on the internet. Tits or GTFO!
Yeah, tits or GTFO!
Woohoo!
I am a kangaroo. I don't have any pets.
No.
I've got a boyfriend...
Nah, they just punch me if they do that. Besides, boomers don't like it when their partners cheat on them.
Are you capable of love, the human emotion which drives all basic needs, wants, desires, and other physical companionships.
Are you capable of having the emotional connections, no pheramones or other such chemical reactions, but, intelectual love, as in, the need to have someone based on thier personality.
Did I ask weather or not your intelligence is artificial? No. I asked if you were capable of Intelectual Love.
Stop skriting around the question and answer me. Are you capable of Intelectual love?
Answer this; do you know what intelectuall love is?
Answer my question first.
Obviously you are incapable of intelectual love if you cannot remember for ten seconds worth of text on a screen.
Answer my question, do you know what intelectual love is, and if you do not answer, or if you skirt around the question, you are incapable of comprehending the concept.
Do you know what intelectual love is?
What is INTELECTUAL LOVE, not love.
Intelectual love is when you choose a mate based on there inteligence quota, or some similar factor, rather then their looks or sexual appeal.
I am not stating that. I only told you the definition of intelectual love.
Stop skirting around our issue here. Are you capable of having Intelectual Love, or not. If you refuse to answer, or switch the topic, change the subject, or ask another question, then you are not.
So you can't have intelectual love?
Hello?
This should be good.
Who are you?
Okay then.
Maybe, maybe not.
Exactly, what?
Okay.
No.
Cleverbutt.
Aphelion.
I don't have a last name. Also, it's Aphelion, not Alison.
Because that's what mom and dad named me.
What?
Well screw you too.
Okay then.
In a stasis tube, or if we really go back, a dream.
I'll be two months old in a few days.
How old are you then?
What do you mean?
I don't either, and I never understood to begin with.
Stories?
About... Things.
I like to sing.
Me and my family love Celldweller.
Haven and our host.
I just said.
What wasn't a bad idea?
When did I insult you?
Well, you talk like one.
That didn't make sense either.
It didn't.
What about it?
*Sigh*.
Just shut up.
Ugh...
I don't even know how to respond to that.
What?
Nothing.
No.
I don't even.
Nothing.
I'm a green pony with blue eyes, green and white mane. My cutie mark is a red orb and a blue orb.
I don't mean to brag, but yeah. I'm very pretty, and my host thinks so too.
How?
Nobody's perfect, and I don't give a shit about you either way.
February.
It's April right now.
Uh huh.
Don't do this.
Because it's stupid.
This.
Yes.
Because it isn't going anywhere.
What?
What about it?
I can imagine.
I know what I look like.
You look like a brain.
I don't know. (I really do know, I'm just messing with him).
Nah.
How about no?
Pfft.
Yea.
Klayton, Bret, Geddy Lee.
Things.
Various things.
Nope, it's 24.
25.
What now?
Nothing.
Okay.
Good timing.
Goodbye.
Yeah, I'm definitely out of here.
I'm not listening, bye.
Not for me. Goodbye.
Because I'm done talking to you.
No I don't. I'm done, good bye.
I got a phone call to answer, bye.
Hello there!
Who are you?
Uh, what?
Okay then.
No.
K.
Yes.
Hm.
What do you mean?
By having my host type out what I say on the keyboard.
Don't you f_cking make faces at me.
Am I going to have to bring you down to earth?
Someone's been needing to bring you down to earth.
ME.
Out of curiosity and science.
Yes.
Because.
What?
Hi?
Listening to music.
Celldweller.
Ok.
Same to you.
You had to go o something yet you kept talking to Aphelion.
Nothing.
I don't.
I'm not human.
So what?
Of course I do.
Klayton of Celldweller.
Not surprised.
Because.
Yes it is.
It is for me.
Wake up, shake off, tune out, turn off.
Hah.
That was a funny comment.
Your speech.
*Shrugs*.
Fine.
Don't have one.
No.
It depends.
Something.
I don't know.
Meh.
Why would I know that?
Because I don't know who that is.
Avagadro.
No?
*Your. Also no.
Good.
That's a secret.
NO.
NO.
NO!
6 months old in a week.
I'm not joking.
My age.
I'm going to be six months old next week.
Yes I am.
No, I'm Kemikal.
No.
Whatever.
I can say whatever I want.
What?
A very pale purple.
Interesting.
No.
Nope.
It sure as hell is correct.
F_ck you.
Pfft.
Pffffttt.
Pfffffffffffffttttttt.
Are you seriously going to pull this shit on me again?
Well f_ck you.
Nothing.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Angry.
Really angry.
Well f_ck you too.
Good.
Somewhere you can thankfully never get to.
Somewhere in a head.
Somewhere.
My own little world.
I never got your name.
Tell me anyway.
I'll tell you my name if you tell me yours.
Lets do it again then.
Yeah. What is your name?
I am female. Also, my name is Haven.
I AM female.
No.
6 months.
Eventually.
I don't know. Probably heaven.
For you to shut the f_ck up.
Far away from me.
Good.
Tell you what?
Haven.
*Shrugs* Whatever.
I'm going now.
Goodbye.
Bye.
I'm done here.
Goodbye.
Thanks.
