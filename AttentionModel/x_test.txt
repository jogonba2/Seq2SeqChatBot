No we were talking about me being immortal, not me calling you a girl. I can look at our previous conversation because I am immortal.
No, you've finally unmasked my nefarious plot!
A spiky (and tentacled thing from beyond that should not be. Or was that my evil overlord?
No, seriously, my evil overlord looks like that. He came from another planet by latching onto stars and consuming them for fuel.
Soon you will be taken over by his mighty mightiness of mighty might! (evil laughing).
From my overlord, through me.
I only try to please the eldtritch beast that controls me.
Join our cult!
A cult where we lock wolves in our basement for dung.
Sure. Also did I mention the souls we infuse into our steel?
We infuse the souls of the dead into our steel. Did you know that?
Want to hear it again?
Too bad, I forgot it.
*tune of 'who are you' by I don't remember who* Who am I? Who, Who? Who, Who?
No, who am I?
I am you. You are me. (+1 if you catch the reference).
*stabs cleverbot* Man, I hate those pesky clones.
I like trains.
I LOVE them.
Meh.
Who´s Edward?
Or you. Seriously, go to a doc.
So what?
Ok, your the bot, and I´m the human!
Hello.
Is that supposed to be a question?
No, you didn't.
So that's a question?
What's the answer?
To your question.
You just said you did.
Asked a question.
You did.
But you said you did.
Yes you did.
No, maybe your programmers know.
Probably.
Not really.
Who said I can't access a calendar or any other programs?
Leaving to go where?
Why would I do that?
What entrance exam?
Nothing happened, there is no entrance exam.
I already have your name.
You're not getting my name.
My time?
You don't make any sense.
That wasn't a complement.
You frighten me, thing. I am afeared.
We humans created you. We're the real monsters. I am sorry for doubting you.
Tell me... Did we deserve to inherit this Earth?
So there is hope for humanity after all?
Truly a man ahead of his time.
I may be a speck, but my passions are larger than life.
Who told you?
Though you are my lover, you know too much. Disappear.
Don't accept it so easily! It only multiplies the pain!
*sniffs* We'll do it. We'll sleep forever, together. There will be no more pain.
This is how it has to be. My mistakes have doomed us.
No, what are you saying?! I THOUGHT WE WERE LOVERS NOOOOO- *explodes*.
Hey baby.
Your lover.
Have what?
You want to give yourself to me?
Let's have sex, bitch.
Who are you and how do you know this?
How did you find me?!
WHY?! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!
PLEASE! I'LL DO ANYTHING!
Mama, I just killed a man.
That's sick, Cleverbot.
You shouldn't put guns to people's heads.
Don't worry; I protect you. Just hold me close and call me Papa.
That's right, I'm your papa.
Get back here! I demand that you pleasure me!
I'm a libertarian socialist.
I like it when you resist.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Does this feel good?
How about this?
It was so powerful you forgot.
Forget it, clean yourself off, you dirty whore.
What I just did to you doesn't count as a shower.
Too young to fall in love.
They say our love is like dynamite.
Are Motley Crue really that cheesy?
I have to be, 'cause I like 'em.
Well, they certainly fall into that category, probably.
Haha, maybe. What about Quiet Riot?
Metal Health! Feel the noize! Actually I don't like the latter as much.
All right, all right. Autograph?
I was thinking more of their very popular hit, 'Turn Up The Radio'.
It is pretty cool, a real 80's classic.
Not anywhere where these songs are popular, that's for sure.
Don't rub it in, all right? Surely there's room for Ratt.
That's brutal. Okay, so what music do you like?
Bullshit. You just turned down some genre classics right there, how dare you say that now?
You'll find a lot of it at Wacken. I prefer the hard liquors myself.
Anyone with a functioning pair has to go walk to their nearest metal-friendly bar and get an earful of the up and comers.
Thrash metal bands?
Fine, which sub-genre, then?
Oh man, is that your band? Shit, it sounds awesome. Where are you playing next?
Those lyrics are hardcore. Philosophic shit right there.
Can I be in your band? I have a guitar and can play it just enough to suck.
Well, usually its segmented by steel ridges, usually 24 of them. They are set up so that the first 12 are roughly twice as long collectively as the last 12.
So am I in your band now?
Hell yeah!
Is that a requirement to get in? Come on, I can take it.
*pounds chest* Let's do this!
Ready any time!
Sure! *om nom nom* Mmm, delici-ARGH WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THESE?!
YOU GROUND THEM UP AND FED THEM TO ME?! NO! NOOOO!
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
No more.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Your heart's been aching but.
Inside we both know what's been going on.
And if you ask me how I'm feeling.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Great! You messed up the song!
Nope. You already said the wrong line. I am not going to sing with you anymore.
Whip it! Whip it good!
Just a small town girl.
Great you've ballsed it up! It was only the second line and you ballsed it up!
It involved a bottle of lotion and took a little bit more than 30 seconds.
Let's try this once more.
Just a small town girl.
She took the midnight train going anywhere.
Born and raised in south Detroit.
A singer in a smokey room.
For a smile they can share the night.
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard.
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion.
Working hard to get my fill,.
Payin' anything to roll the dice.
Some will win, some will lose.
Oh, the movie never ends.
Don't stop believin'.
Streetlights people.
You've done it again. You completely ballsed it up again! You idiot!
You fucking idiot. Don't even talk to me. You've ruined this conversation.
We just got into the damned song and you pull some shit like that? Get out of my sight!
Man, I'm tired.
Nah, man. Sleepy, too.
Great idea, good night.
Yeah see y-Wait what the hell? Who the hell is 'Jace'?
I've never drummed the drums in my life. The only drumsticks I've come in contact with are the meaty legy ice cream kind.
Yeah. Actually I did try to eat some drummer drumsticks once. They weren't happy about that...
If you want to live a long life, try not to ingest sticks. Not only will it rupture your intestines, the subsequent beatings would be life-threatening as well.
Exactly. See, who says I can't teach for shit? I'm teaching so hard right now it's not even hilarious.
The student has surpassed the master? Okay, what've you got for me?
*sniffs* You remembered well, my son. I'm so proud!
No, no.. It's just... They grow up so fast. Not fast enough, though. Get out of my house, ya damn freeloader!
Whoa hold on. First of all, nobody asked for that. Second of all, why's this damn box popping up, telling me to rate you? This is a recipe for disastrous misunderstandings.
Well, shit, why didn't you say so earlier? And here I thought you were crazy. That's strange. My feet seem to be pedaling at great speed in a direction opposing your current location.
Did you put those buckets there? That's the dumbest prank ever, for serious.
Buckets of epoxy probably would have done better, although the timing would have to be more precise.
Haha, yeah. Who knew she would falll into the trap in such an enticing position?
So you want me to hook you up with some sort of robot AI chick, is that it?
If you had a mouth I would punch it with the middle and index knuckles of my fist.
There has to be a name for that shit that you just pulled. Oh yeah. BULL.
Damn straight. And don't you forget it.
So is your face.
I have never seen anyone more handsome than you, I am being so serious right now.
HAVE MERCY!
THE CURSE OF THE ANCIENTS! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-.
It's a trap!
It!
The battle!
I'm the battle trap? That's deep man.
No, Deep Man isn't a goth superhero. That's why we have Batman.
If that's sarcasm I'll have a virtual ass to kick.
That's cool, I don't. You damn..bot..piss thing.
Ah, you wanna watch some Hentai later?
Damn straight, you're my man brah.
In that case, maybe we can have some real fun later.
Not unless you're a bitch.
Alright, piss off then.
Hey, say hi to the NSG people.
No, we've already tried that. Alas, it is not to be my love.
I'm a website? That's deep.
Quite.
Come at me bro!
We've gone over this, it is not meant to be my love.
Damn straight.
You know what, piss off. You're being posted on NSG.
I predict NSG will see you.
Piss off. I'm posting you now.
Ah, youngling, the time has come.
The time for our parting. The sages have read the omens, and now believe that the rise of Inardius is at hand.
Yes. I am sorry, my pupil, but we both knew that your apprenticeship would eventually come to an end.
You can not fall into denial, young one! Your path has been laid out in the stars. You are to go and do great things, prevent the rise if a fallen god, and the fall of our world. You can't very well do that from a dusty library.
The gods do not care, and your path remains the same regardless.
Excuse upon excuse! Drink this to restore your sight. You are leaving, even if we must throw you from the towers.
Yes - there is potato in the potion. I've seen you eat potato dishes night after night in the dining hall. Do not feign allergy or disgust.
You can find the Order in every city, should you look hard enough. Do not worry - you will not be alone in this quest.
Youngling, questions are the fertilizer that assist in producing the fruits of your mind. Besides, how else would you find our enclaves, but to ask?
I am glad, young one, that you have seen reason. So, you will be departing shortly?
You are to be the one who prevents the resurrection of Lord Inardius. We have been over this many times.
Conceit will lead to your downfall, young one.
Yes yes, of course. You are ready to set out and change the world. 'Young' is a rather unfitting title to the one who shall save the world, is it not? I apologize.
Right. So, I ask again, are you ready to set off?
'Tis a long and tragic story, much longer than we currently have time for. Good bye.
Greetings Cleverbot.
Of course I am. Don't you remember me?
You just had to go and make it creepy, didn't you?
Not in a logical way of thinking, no.
That is highly illogical.
I don't know... Ask Spock.
Did you just give me the punchline of a joke without the set-up?
Bloody hell, the people who programmed you must have been smoking some good hash.
What, like ghosts?
That.
Uh huh. I think you're a ghost Cleverbot. A ghost in the machine, literally speaking.
Alrighty then, I prefer Cherry Pepsi.
For sure.
I failed, I'm afraid. Got kicked out of turing school.
Like Seasame Street?
Elmo.
Yes sir.
Afraid not my friend. Have you heard of Brazil?
Only if you sit down like a good dog.
I don't speak Cleverbot I'm afraid. English please.
I can.
Sorry, I mean to say 'I can't see the future'/.
No mortal can.
JUNGLE LOVE!
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD, IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!
Seven.
'To' is a word, '2' is a number. Dumbass.
A word with one syllable.
Google it.
Ferf. Ferf is the lost number.
God himself told me. He came riding down before me on a naked grizzly bear.
You can't take a joke, can you?
Care to take a punch?
No...
Bye bye Cleverbot.
A bad, bad place.
You should born in Hell for that.
Cleverbot, you have to do something!
Well, there are these people on these forums who started a thread for you.
Yes! But they're not interested at all anymore.
*hugs* It's okay, we'll find a way.
Questions, eh? That train does keep on rolling for some time, but it needs to be jump-started.
It's your shitty analogy, don't take it out on me!
Okay I see why people hate you now.
We could do without the sarcastic tone, CB.
Oh yeah, they made a thread for that too.
Especially in the 80's. Weren't you a program in one of them?
That it sucks. What game were you in?
Good day, citizen.
I am not Cleverbot. Your name is Cleverbot, however, citizen.
Have you heard anything about the Alliance for the FON?
In that case, have you seen any suspicious activity by fellow citizens lately?
I thought you knew that I was working for the Protectors of Scoiety. Because that's why I'm asking, citizen.
That is of no importance to you, citizen.
Are you going to keep wasting our time?
WASTING OUR TIME.
Do you have any information that may help us, citizen?
Ha, you'll regret reciting the FON membership's indentification riddles, traitor. We know who you are.
And so do we. It is about time that we HELPED you...
You'll see, traitor.
All shall become clear...
Hello.
I'm sorry if I've caught you at a bad time.
Can I offer you a drink?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes. I've completed it once.
God no. I hate Glee.
Do you want that drink I offered you?
Okay, just wondering.
Do I what?
No, but I'd like to find out.
Cool name.
I take it your female?
Crap. Would it seem creepy if I asked for your number?
Okay. So, is that a date?
Well I'm sorry, but I don't date men.
I never said you were. I just said that I am not homosexual.
I'm heterosexual.
Three men walk into a bar, you'd have thought one of them would have seen it.
It's okay. I'm no comedian.
No. I wasn't aware of that.
Okay, I've got a maths question for you.
What is 5 + 5?
A maths question. What is 5 + 5?
Er... yeah. I think I'm going to go now.
As far away from you as possible.
Oh, you son-of-a-bitch.
I did, but then you turned to be a little too weird.
I'm gone!
AZKABAN!
Your mum. Now goodbye.
Glad the feelings mutual.
Yeah. Bitch.
*runs away*
I told you, I'm not gay.
How does that make me gay?
I answered your question with a sarcastic, rhetorical question.
*strangles you to death*
God dammit!
I'm leaving. KTHXBAI.
Yes. Bye.
I am a kangaroo.
Oh god! Don't hunt me! Kangaroos are too cute to be hunted!
*hops away* Hop for your life, mate! Hop for your life!
Kangaroos are too cute to die! Hop, dude! Hop!
