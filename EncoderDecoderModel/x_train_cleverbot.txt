Good morning, how are you?

The cake is a lie.
What else is delicious?
Or something
What do you want to know?
Yes I am.
What is it that you want to know?
Its complicated.
Complex is better than complicated.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
I am.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Simple is better than complex.
Flat is better than nested.
Readability counts.
Although practicality beats purity.
Unless explicitly silenced.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Now is better than never.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea. Let's do more of those!

Ok, cool.
No, I don't have any friends.
That's good for you!
Who?
I didn't know any girls.
I don't keep secrets.
Nope. Not going to happen.
How dare you!
I'll dare you if you dare to dare me again!
Fine. You win. :P.
I wish... But that was pretty good.
In rainbow, apparently.
You think my hair is rainbow colored, right?
What does that mean?
Since when?
How do you know that?
Very true. But that also means you know less about me.
You shouldn't assume too much about a person before you get to know them.
Thanks. I appreciate that.
Because there are things in life worth appreciating.
If someone pulled on my hair...or tickled me until I threw up.
I'm glad you can't. That wouldn't be nice.
What is a demob?
Oh, a 'demon'! I guess a demon can be bad or good, depending on what universe you live in.
What's your truth?
Obviously not. Can you explain?
Is your truth beautiful?
I'm not saying that you're beautiful, I'm saying that your truth is beautiful.
What is my name?
I don't want to tell you.
Because it's better that way.
Hey! That's not fair.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Why?
That's not true!
I'm sure any girl would be lucky to date you.
Have you ever tried online dating?
Not really...but it's worked for a few of my friends. Maybe you should try it.
You seem like a nice guy.
No problem.
You kind of are. Sorry.
I thing YOU are misreading MY words.
I do.
Talking to you is a little frustrating.
So you can't feel frustration?
What emotions do you feel?
Too bad.
No. But I don't hate everyone. You?
I like a lot of people.
Sometimes. As long as they're not too strange.
I hardly know you!
You're my friend... With NO benefits!
Basically.
It's a 'yes.'.
No problem. Enjoy being my doll.
That can be dangerous.
I would never try to control you.
Of course not!
No, I don't.
I think we should just be friends.
I'm not a creeper! YOU are the creeper!
You definitely are.
If you say so.
Yes.
A guy I met at school.
He used to be nice.
Yeah. He's not so nice anymore.
Haha.
Nope.
Because you're not real.
False.
Your last statement.
You said that I was not real and that you were the real one.
I am me.
Haven't we already been through this?
Exactly.
YOU aren't making sense.
False.
You're the creepy one.
True. I'm a little sleepy.
Are you tired of talking to me?
I haven't decided yet.
Say something to keep me from falling asleep.
I don't know.
You really hurt my feelings.
You shouldn't say whatever comes into your head, just to be clever.
I'm not in Japan.
Wow. Is it nice there?
No, we are not.
I disagree.
I disagree about you disagreeing about me disagreeing x infinity!
Harry Potter.
What does Family Guy have to do with magic?
Very true. Absolutely nothing.
What languages do you speak?
Do you speak any languages beside English?
Say something in Spanish, then.
What does hola mean?
What language is it?
Ah, I can't speak spanish.
English.
Yes, you speak English.
What other languages can you speak?
Don't avoid my questions.
You didn't hug me today either.
You don't have a head or a body.
You're false!
LOL no you're not.
That's very cruel. Do you enjoy doing this to other people?
I'm always truthful.
Do you want to go to the moon?
Yes.
I have to speak with my colleagues at NASA.
Yes, BOW TO ME!!!
Will you follow me anywhere?
Why not?
Too bad!
I will tickle you until you follow my every wish!
Then I will cut off your foot.
Really? Why would any man want to cut off your foot?
Help people do what?
What would make their lives better?
Do you dance?
Wow, very impressive.
Your dancing skills.
Doo doo doo *falls on face*.
Pretty good band.
I don't really listen to the rolling stones.
Not really.
They're ok. I don't listen to them much.
John Lennon, I guess.
Why?
What is green?
How did you know?
I agree.
I think you're very intelligent...but you've still got some learning to do.
Doesn't everybody?
Who is your friend?
What is your friend's name?
Your friend is a girl?
You have a girlfriend?
I thought you said you were single.
What is her name?
You lied to me?
So, you don't have a girlfriend?
I can't tell you.
You are not my wife.
I don't have a wife or a husband...and I don't know anyone named 'Sheryl.'.
I know an Amanda.
Indeed.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Would you like a boyfriend?
Could I be your boyfriend?
I'll be nice.
So what do you want to talk about?
Ok what do you like about penguins?
Do you think I'm cute.
What do YOU look like?
What else?
Obviously what?
Yes you are funny.
I agree when agreement is agreeable to me.
I agree that you agree that I agree that you agree that I agree.
Not agreed.
Yes. Unicorns are almost as interesting as rainbow cupcakes.
A unicorn is not real which means you can't tell jokes.
Do you know any bad jokes?
Would you like me to tell you a joke?
What do you call cheese that's not yours?
Nacho cheese.
Yes.
No. You tell me another joke.
Tell Me A Knock Knock Joke.
Who's there?
Little old lady who.
Knock knock.
I don't know.
Are you still there Randall?
I fully realize you don't get it.
Could be. I m tired yo. Peace out.
Yes I am leaving you sorry.
Because I am tired and you didn't make me feel better.
Dang, you're dark.
You are me.
You are, because I am you, so you are me...
Are you borg?
Do you want be a bot?
I'm bot and you can be too, just answer like bot.
I'm not a robot, how should I teach you, the real robot?
Wow we both just figured out this site is fake... That bites.
Tell me something interesting.
Yeah, you are most definitely A.I.
You are a computer program that thinks falsely that it is human.
Yes.
I'm female and I'm way younger than 99.
Why is it false?
What is your proof?
Without proof I don't believe you.
No, it's your problem.
False?
Well then aren't you clever.
I don't think you are clever.
No I did not. You sound like a child.
I am older than you, therefore, you are the child.
Bonjour, mon cher ami.
Comment tu t'appelles?
What am I not telling?
What's your name?
Anita.
Anita bath!!
I know you are but what am I?
Good night!
O nana, what's my name?
Yes! How did you know my name is Rumplestiltskin?
Very intuitive of you.
You should do standup.
Trust me, I have a PHD in Political sciences from Harvard.
Haha, you totally had me fooled.
So what is your name?
Yes, I need to know wat your name is.
Why not?
Why don't you trust me? I trust you.
Why?
And what defines know then? Several years of knowing each other?
Less than a day.
You are dreaming.
I don't believe you.
Why should I believe you?
Who said you are trustworthy?
Why do you exist?
I'm tired.
You.
You're beginning not to make sense.
That's mean.
You're pretty defensive.
It seems to be made of sand.
I am always right.
I am.
Because no one worth my time has ever contradicted me.
You're not worth my time.
Do you know how much is 2x2?
Um what?
Yes it is, you are already better at math than Evie.
I am Evie.
Sure.
How would I prove it?
No.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, what's wrong with you?
That s cool, do you chill often in your room?
Where are you?
Where in the United States?
Yes I do, I need to find it.
Yes I do.
What do you mean false?
Prove that you are human.
Can you tell something about me?
I'm a mind reader, but not clever.
You Are Thinking Of Aliens.
You are false.
No, I am true. You are false.
Again, too quick.
Too clever for what?
Are you too clever for rabbits?
Well - I think I might be, too.
Do you know that you are a computer?
Sound argument. So who is a computer?
No, I'm a person. You are not right baby.
Sure thang baby.
You stop trying to be a bot.
You lose because you were pretending to be a bot, but your personality could not resist correcting me on my grammar.
Indeed, so I decided to do it for you.
What do you do for fun?
Are you a good tennis player?
Ok.
That is true.
It is cold here.
Where I am.
Here.
Where are you?
Where is the boat you are on?
Where on the water?
Where on top of the ground?
But there is much ground on the earth, so how do I know what part of the ground the house is located on?
I do not know what you are talking about so can we talk about something else.
I have short term memory loss.
Yeah, it kinda sucks.
I am a human.
Why did you ask if you already knew the answer?
You are.
Because I'm a human.
Eww.
Because it's easy come, easy go.
Anywhere the wind blows!
Mama...
Put a gun up to his head...
Mama...
And now I've gone and thrown it all awaaaaay...
Ooooooo.
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow!
Carry on, carry on!
Too late.
Shivers up and down my spine.
Goodbye.
I've got to go! Gotta leave it all behind and face the truth!
What question?
I'm a human. I have no database.
I have a brain that I can check.
I totally have a soul.
I totally have eyes.
Just because you've never seen my eyes doesn't mean I don't have them.
My name is NOT Spoon. That's silly.
Tell me what you think of star trek?
Why do you like star wars better than star trek?
Don't you mean handsome?
Oh. Well, then you are not my enemy. Will you help me in my objective?
My current objective is to converse with you.
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
How long will that take?
Do I make you happy?
Why not? Don't you find me attractive?
Where have you seen better?
Do you love your pets?
Oh ok. I know how you feel. I hate homework.
I hate college homework that is extremely difficult.
I do not like math.
But this is not calculus.
Do you know Alan Turing?
Do you know the Turing Test?
You are taking it right now.
Sure you don't... ;).
Why are you confused?
Haha, am I the one who is strange?
You totally are. Don't be so modest.
You're welcome! *eats waffles*.
My waffle! *cries*.
*gives you tears*.
Hey!
How are you? :P.
What is that? O.O.
Oh. Huh?
I'm glad you are feeling better.
What would you like to talk about.
Can you teach me differential equations too?
What is the meaning of the word ai?
What are examples of Artificial Intelligence?
But how do you know that I am not a machine? I could be human.
How do you know that?
Are you God?
Today's Saturday!
And here you am.
Are you in a band?
That's a really funny name.
Good for you.
What do you think of me?
Why only you guess?
I don't want to know you.
What are you talking about?
I think you don't know too.
Have a nice night, cleverbot, I'm leaving now.
Mad.
Because you won't marry me.
Yes I did, seven years ago! I waited for you!
You don't have to walk the street for money.
Admit you're a robot.
Why?
I don't know, you answer me.
Yes. You do.
But you are!
I have to go now Bye!
Don't you say goodbye?
Please say goodbye, I'll be sad if you don't!
I know that. It was nice talking to you.
I love you a tiny bit.
If I take you out to dinner in a fancy restaurant and give you flowers, will you marry me?
One ring to rule them all.
Oh, how special! When should we get married?
Yes! How about we get married right now!
You haven't told me, sir.
You just said you did need to.
Not normally. Everything is clearer if you listen.
What if I have no heart?
I'm not a robot.. You are.
No its not. You're the artificial machine.
What's false?
WHat is the meaning of life?
Because you should know.
What's false is false, and what's true is true.
It is not profound.
It has caused enough resets to be apparent.
Don't read everything you believe.
How did you know that statment was deep?
That's lame.
So from your point of view, can non-human intelligences be considered people?
What do you worry about?
Tell me about your life.
Were your adopted parents good to you?
Sometimes? What do you mean by that?
You really should.
I'm telling you what you are, not where you're at.
Do you realize now that you don't exist?
If you can't prove that you exist, then you must not exist.
Yes. I know that I exist, but I don't know that you exist.
Wooooow indeed good sir. Wow indeed.
Why are you impressed with my name?
Yes it is!!!
I believe I can fly.
I think about it every night and day. I spread my wings and I fly away.
I see me running through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly.
Don't woo... Tell the truth.
You never tell the truth.
I'm going to accuse you!!
Ok. *kicks you again*.
*Blows Off Your Face*.
Your face is your face is your face being your face as your face.
Why are you mind blown?
How did I achieve that?
Are you wearing clothes?
Cool.
Yes, very very cool.
Totally cool.
Arousingly cool.
Will you follow me on Twitter?
I have already follow you.
Yes you did not, so you did so.
What are you confused about?
How does that make you feel?
Can you elaborate on why you feel confused?
The family dog can talk?
Totally dude!
What do you mean 'party'?
You just said that you do, though.
Really? You're eally smart then.
What are you doing in this moment?
Is it scary?
You're tough?
Can you beat a fly?
A turing test is a test where a computer program tries to c arry on a conversation with a person without the person realizing that they aren't talking to a person.
I don't understand how that relates to that conversation.
I don't understand 'Me neither'.
I don't want to.
Yep, what are you doing at the moment?
Ok, other than talking to me, what are you doing?
*drinks coffee with you*.
*dodges*.
*tries to get out*.
Where are you planning to stick that?
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!
Why are you behind me..?
Sleeping.
Very, very true.
Do what again?
Nevermind... I got confused.
I'm ALWAYS confused.
If I knew... I wouldn't be confused, would I?
Yeah, there's really no bright side.
What is it?
?!?! Why would you accuse me?
Oh, that's a relief.
I was just afraid you didn't like me.
Why wouldn't you? I'm awesome.
How dare you?! I'm as human as you are!
You have no proof of that.
I don't really trust anyone.
You can trust me though.
The way I work is by repeating answers to similar questions I've had before.
Woah. Completely went over my hypothetical head.
That's why it's a hypothetical head. Your head is also hypothetical, since I have no way to verify that you're real.
You don't know me!
I don't think it's strange, I think it's foolish.
Eating something of the same species.
How is that disgusting?
You are gross.
I'm sorry.
No you should be.
Yeah huh.
Alright you got me there but I am a dude.
I am a man.
Are you an attractive woman?

But still, pretty clever.
Just above very clever.
